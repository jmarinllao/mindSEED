Do you know how your employees are feeling? Are they dreading another work week, or are they looking forward to engaging days with their team? The latter is what every company strives for, and it’s easier to achieve than you think with an effective employee recognition and reward program.</p>
<p>Employee recognition has a significant impact on key business metrics like engagement, productivity, and retention. Creating an impactful employee recognition and reward program is within reach for every organization, but it requires the right knowledge, planning, and resources.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/">Discover the benefits of recognition in the Achievers 2021 Engagement and Retention Report</a></p>
<h2>Understanding recognition and rewards</h2>
<p>Recognition and rewards might sound similar, but there are important differences between them. Recognition encompasses both social and monetary recognition, while rewards typically only refer to monetary recognition. Let’s look at these two types of recognition in more detail.</p>
<h3>Social recognition</h3>
<p>Social recognition can take the form of a quick shout-out during a company meeting, a personalized message of thanks from your manager, or even a digital badge that commends specific qualities or actions. It’s a great way to validate and encourage behaviors that align with your company culture. When social recognition is a frequent occurrence, team members feel proud, more involved, and eager to recognize their fellow employees in turn.</p>
<p>When you are putting together your social recognition plan, make sure that it includes opportunities for <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/peer-to-peer-recognition/">peer-to-peer recognition</a>. Impactful, effective recognition doesn’t always have to come from the top. Recognition is most powerful when it comes from both peers and leaders. Make sure that your <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-software/">employee recognition platform</a> allows any employee to easily show recognition whenever and wherever they prefer. An inclusive program that supports peer-to-peer recognition empowers every team member to be a recognition champion.</p>
<h3>Monetary recognition</h3>
<p>Monetary recognition includes salary increases, bonuses, travel, and gift cards. Rewards like these <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/the-positive-spiral-of-frequent-employee-appreciation/">make employees feel appreciated</a> for the work they do each day. Personalizing these rewards to suit the recipient boosts the impact even further, but engaging in a search for the perfect gift each time your organization wants to tangibly recognize an employee is impractical. And it doesn’t allow all team members to actively participate in the rewards experience.</p>
<p>To square this circle, adopt an employee recognition solution that supports points-based rewards. Employers provide a number of points to each employee every month or quarter. Employees then give these points to colleagues, together with social recognition, and team members can redeem them for rewards they choose from a wide-ranging catalog. Personal rewards employees actually want versus pre-selected, one-size-fits-all gifts make a points-based reward system an easy choice.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits of implementing a recognition and reward program?</h2>
<p>Employee recognition is the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/">number one driver of engagement</a>, and a recognition and reward program is the surest route to boosting employee engagement and retention. Here are a few powerful statistics on the importance of recognition and rewards from the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/">Achievers 2021 Engagement and Retention Report</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over one fifth of workers name recognition as the top reason to remain in their current role — the most common reason given other than work-life balance</li>
<li>Sixty-nine percent of employees believe their relationship with their manager would improve if they recognized them more</li>
<li>The more recently someone is recognized, the higher their engagement is likely to be</li>
<li>The more frequently an employee was recognized, the less likely they were to job hunt</li>
<li>Eighty-five percent of employees say that they are motivated to work harder when they receive recognition</li>
</ul>
<p>These numbers show that it’s essential to make recognition a part of employees’ everyday experience, rather than saving it for exceptional performance or showing it solely through raises and bonuses.</p>
<h2>Designing a recognition and reward program</h2>
<p>To start realizing the benefits of a well-designed recognition and rewards program at your organization, follow these four best practices.</p>
<h3>1. Recognize employees frequently</h3>
<p>In order to get the most out of your reward and recognition program, you need to make sure employees receive recognition on a regular basis. <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/frequency-the-key-to-recognition-and-engagement-with-meghan-m-biro/">Frequent recognition</a> builds a strong culture of appreciation, has a stronger, longer-lasting impact on morale, and increases the use of your recognition program. Every time organizations double the number of recognitions in their company, they can expect an overall engagement <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-state-of-recognition-report/">increase of 5%</a>. Implement an easy-to-use employee recognition platform to help get all team members involved with providing recognition on a daily basis.</p>
<h3>2. Link recognition to specific actions</h3>
<p>What gets recognized gets repeated, so clearly linking recognition to positive behavior will encourage employees to double-down on actions you want to see more of. <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/2020-engagement-retention-report/">Ninety-two percent of employees</a> agree that when they are recognized for a specific action, they are more likely to repeat that action. This means that employers can use recognition programs to highlight behaviors they want to emphasize and encourage <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/5-things-amazing-company-mission-statements-all-have-in-common/">in line with their company’s mission</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Solicit and act on feedback</h3>
<p>Developing a successful recognition and rewards program is not a one-time project. It’s essential to continuously collect feedback on your employee recognition program, preferably using <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">tools like pulse surveys</a> and always-on, intelligent feedback channels like <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/hr-chatbots/">AI-powered HR chatbots</a>. Employee feedback shows how employees honestly feel about your recognition and reward program and reveals new approaches to make your program more effective.</p>
<p>To get the most out of the feedback you collect, you must <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">measure and act on it</a>. Guided by an employee engagement platform, managers can <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-action-plans/">address issues collaboratively with their teams</a>. Feedback from smaller groups can be used to test and tweak new employee recognition initiatives, ensuring sustainable success when the time comes for larger rollouts and resulting in a flexible recognition and rewards program that meets your employees’ needs.</p>
<h2>Ramp up your recognition and reward program today</h2>
<p>The best reward and recognition programs are built on the foundation of a modern, mobile-friendly employee recognition platform. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/">Achievers Recognize</a> makes it easy to build a better culture through recognition and rewards. It encourages active employee participation through combining fun social recognition with personalized points-based rewards.

Getting your employees actively involved in business decisions and priorities makes them feel empowered and keeps them motivated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/empowerment-and-trust-the-keys-to-employee-engagement/">Discover how to create a culture of feedback with employee listening</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">Supporting employee voice</a> means team members can deliver their ideas and feedback to leaders without fear of judgment or other ramifications. Any organization that wants a winning culture has to enable employee voice while avoiding potential pitfalls. Let’s explore how you can leverage the power of employee voice at your company.</p>
<h2>The advantages of employee voice</h2>
<p>Employee voice keeps your organization fresh and vital. When your finger is on the pulse of employee engagement and workers know their opinions actually matter, business success is sure to follow. Here are some of the biggest ways employee voice can impact your company for the better.</p>
<h3>More engaged employees</h3>
<p>Employee engagement means that team members are genuinely excited about working for your organization. Giving employees a voice with tools like <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">pulse surveys</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">always-on, AI-powered feedback channels</a> is an excellent way to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-ideas-activities/">boost employee engagement and motivation</a>. Employee engagement is <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">one of the keys to business success</a>, so empowering employees to share their insights should be one of your top priorities. </p>
<h3>Honest, actionable feedback</h3>
<p>Feedback is an invaluable tool for identifying and resolving issues before they impact your company’s bottom line. Anonymous feedback is the best way to get your employees’ honest thoughts on problems at your organization that may be flying under the radar. You can then put together an action plan in response to this feedback and fix problems that might otherwise drive your best talent elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Empowered employees</h3>
<p>When employees see that giving voice to their concerns actually has an impact on your organization, their <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-empowerment/">feeling of empowerment</a> will affect all areas of your business. Team members will be more likely to ask for help, resources, and flexibility when they need it. And they’ll have the confidence to try to learn new skills, take on additional responsibilities, and pursue other opportunities for professional development.</p>
<h3>A happier, healthier workforce</h3>
<p>Stress has a serious impact on both <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/boost-employee-morale/">employee morale</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-wellness-programs/">employee wellness</a>. Unfortunately, without anonymous feedback channels, your organization won’t know what’s causing employees stress and how to address it. Unaddressed sources of stress can <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/burnout-job/">result in burnout</a> throughout your organization. But when employees can express how they truly feel, and your organization acts on that feedback quickly — like by implementing additional PTO or scheduling flexibility to address work-life balance issues — morale and wellness will rise.</p>
<h2>The challenges of employee voice</h2>
<p>Enabling employee voice isn’t like flipping a switch. From failing to act on feedback to failing to properly train managers, there are more than a few icebergs that your efforts to support employee voice can run aground on.</p>
<h3>Failing to act on feedback</h3>
<p>If you give your employees the opportunity to share feedback, it’s important that you take that feedback into account and make an action plan to address the things brought up. You need to take your employee engagement survey results into account, or your employees will feel neglected and not listened to. Soliciting the feedback and not acting on it can be worse than not requesting the feedback in the first place, so make sure you develop an action plan when you get your <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">survey results</a> in. </p>
<h3>Managers struggling to adjust</h3>
<p>Employee feedback is important so that managers can grow and develop as well, but if managers can’t adjust to receiving feedback, this can have a detrimental effect on employee happiness and morale. Managers should be able to transition from a controlling, micromanaging approach to serving as more of a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/managers-as-coaches/">supportive coach</a>, which will allow employees to feel empowered and express themselves more freely. </p>
<h3>Ensuring employees can express themselves confidentially</h3>
<p>When you’re gathering employee feedback, it’s important that you use anonymous channels so that employees can express themselves freely. If they’re unsure about the anonymity, they might not feel safe to give honest feedback, which in turn can lead to unresolved issues at your company. </p>
<h2>How can your organization support employee voice?</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered the benefits and challenges of implementing employee voice, let’s take a look at how you can take action to embrace employee voice as your company. There are several best practices, including onboarding an employee engagement solution and prioritizing transparency. </p>
<h3>Adopt an employee engagement solution</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to ensure anonymity in employee feedback is by adopting an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">employee engagement solution</a>. Platforms that allow employees to respond to surveys confidently and anonymously are key to amassing the most productive feedback from your teams.</p>
<h3>Build collaborative action plans with employees</h3>
<p>Once you’ve gathered feedback through an employee engagement solution, make sure you work with managers on how best to address the feedback. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-action-plans/">Developing cohesive action plans</a> is key to making sure you can implement any important feedback from employees, which in turn makes employees feel seen and heard.</p>
<h3>Recognize employees for expressing themselves</h3>
<p>Employees are more likely to repeat behaviors they’re recognized for, so showing appreciation for employees who share their thoughts and provide constructive ideas should be a priority. Look for a recognition platform that includes support for both social <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/social-recognition-what-why-and-how/">recognition</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-rewards-ideas/">monetary rewards</a>, the latter in the form of points that employees can redeem for rewards of their choice.</p>
<h3>Prioritize transparency</h3>
<p>If you want to get actionable feedback out of your employees, you need to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/building-trust-workplace/">build trust</a> by prioritizing transparency at your organization. Team members can’t address key issues if they’re not aware of them, or if they don’t believe your organization wants them involved in critical decisions that affect their daily work lives. When employees are fully informed and know your organization trusts them to provide input on the most important business issues, you’ll have the feedback you need to course correct and jump on new opportunities.</p>
<h2>Get your workforce more involved by enabling employee voice</h2>
<p>Getting your employees engaged and using their voice is simple with the right employee engagement solution. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/listen/">Achievers Listen</a> allows you to measure employee engagement with a super sleek, easy-to-use platform that gives you end-to-end data on your workforce. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/demo/">Get a free demo of Achievers Listen today</a> so you can start collecting feedback and taking action as soon as possible.</p>

Achievers’ think tank, the Achievers Workforce Institute found in its global <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/">Workforce Institute 2021 Engagement and Retention Report</a> that 52% of those currently employed intend to leave jobs in 2021 and 46% feel less connected to their employers. Based on Achievers customer success stories, we also know that employees who receive three or more recognitions monthly are six times less likely to leave. <br />
 <br />
But long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/">reward options</a>. The future of work, largely shaped by the impacts of the global pandemic, is now a hybrid experience with on-site, in-office, and remote workplaces — often across a single organization.  <br />
 <br />
Perhaps surprisingly, these complexities in how and where we work have given way to choices. Today’s employee wants (and perhaps even needs) multiple reward options that fit with their work and personal lives. </p>
<h2>A collaboration of firsts with Uber for Business</h2>
<p>Achievers is proud to be the first fully integrated employee experience platform to collaborate with <a href="https://www.uber.com/ca/en/business/">Uber for Business</a> and offer their vouchers within our global Reward Marketplace. This exciting Reward Marketplace addition is yet another way that Achievers is deepening its commitment to employee engagement for the future of work.</p>
<p>Having foresight to this shift in demand for more flexible and diverse rewards options and operations, Achievers worked with Uber for Business to offer vouchers — redeemable for rides with Uber and meals with Uber Eats. Now a part of the Achievers Marketplace, Vouchers from Uber for Business join a catalog of over 2,500 top brand name gifts available to Achievers members.</p>
<p>Operating for over a decade, The Achievers Reward Marketplace is part of the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/">Achievers Employee Experience Platform<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>, a connected ecosystem of integrated products that power relevant and agile employee engagement strategies and activate a culture of belonging through daily employee and leadership participation.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting employees = higher business performance</strong>. For global organizations, the Achievers Reward Marketplace is a proven employee points-based reward system to motivate, inspire, and make employees feel valued. To employees, it’s a wonderland of reward redemption possibilities — one that just got even better.</p>
<p>The decision to offer Vouchers from Uber for Business was a strategic one. The addition of Vouchers to the Achievers Reward Marketplace will first roll out in the US, Canada, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Mexico, with further expansion planned in the future.</p>
<p>“We knew that a large number of employees were experiencing the never-before-seen challenges of balancing their pandemic work lives with the new realities of their home life: being caregivers to family members, supporting school-aged children learning at home, and so on,” said Kristian Gaetano, Achievers Chief Operating Officer. “We also saw a shift in the types of redemptions being made and understood that people were in need of rewards that offered convenience, access, and time savings — and Uber for Business checked all of these boxes.”</p>
<p>A well-known, well-established, and well-loved brand, rides with Uber are supported in 71 countries across 10,000 cities. Similarly, the Uber Eats app is available from over 750,000 restaurants in more than 6,000 cities worldwide. This global presence closely mirrors that of the Achievers Reward Marketplace, which is available in over 150 countries and serves members in 27 languages.  </p>
<p>The value of this reward option goes beyond a free trip across town or a free meal. Organizations partnered with Achievers are demonstrating to their teams that they understand the challenges associated with the current state of work and that being able to order-in dinner after a long day of virtual meetings and corralling children makes employees feel known and included — two of the five critical pillars of belonging identified in the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-culture-of-belonging-at-work/">Achievers Workforce Institute Culture of Belonging Report</a>.</p>
<p>“A true sense of belonging at work is the deepest outcome measure of engagement — and one of the best predictors of the extent to which one will thrive at work,” said Dr. Natalie Baumgartner, Chief Workforce Scientist at Achievers.</p>
<p>Couple this fact with the understanding that frequent recognition is also a primary driver of engagement which directly impacts performance, and the benefits of <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/">Reward Marketplace</a> become clear. Backed by workforce science, this form of strategic recognition and rewards has real-time business impacts. Organizations who integrate the Achievers platform with their flow of work are not only adding value for employees, they are improving business outcomes.</p>
<p>“Hybrid work is the future of work. Even as parts of the world open up and the workforce begins to go into the office, the pandemic has highlighted just how important it will always be to create flexible environments, policies, and perks for employees,” said Susan Anderson, Global Head of Uber for Business. “We know how critical it is to engage with employees, to boost morale, and increase retention – those priorities aren’t going away. That’s why we are proud to work with Achievers to amplify the employee experience and help businesses cultivate a dynamic and lively workplace culture.”</p>
<h2>Engaging and accessible</h2>
<p>Inclusivity and equality of access to rewards is of great importance to Achievers. As with all rewards in the Marketplace, the Uber for Business integration within the Achievers Employee Experience Platform<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is available across devices, meaning that employees can redeem for rides or meals via desktop or mobile.</p>

Leadership and HR must offer what employees really want 一 the feeling that they’re making a real difference in the world. The best workplaces make employees excited to go to work every day, knowing they’re making a positive impact.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-culture-of-belonging-at-work/">Explore the power of a mission-focused culture where everyone belongs with the 2021 Culture Report</a></p>
<p>Generating this level of enthusiasm starts with an inspiring mission statement. Mission statements provide a framework for making important company decisions, influence employee behavior, and even affect customer loyalty. The challenge is creating a mission statement that truly captures what your organization is about.</p>
<h2>What is a mission statement?</h2>
<p>A mission statement is a concise, meaningful sentence (or two) that represents the purpose of your organization. Mission statements are often action-based, explaining how the company’s objectives serve both employees and customers. It’s critical that your mission statement accurately reflects what your company stands for, as it serves as the foundation for all company-wide decisions and operations. Although it’s tough to fit all this into one or two sentences, it’s essential to keep your mission statement short and clear so team members can easily put it into practice.</p>
<h3>Mission statements vs. vision statements vs. company values</h3>
<p>Mission statements, vision statements, and company values relate to each other but serve distinct purposes. Mission statements focus on an organization’s purpose and goals, while vision statements focus on where a company wants to go or what it wants to become. Company values instead represent the philosophies that underlie everything about the organization and its culture. All three help a company define what they do, how they do it, and who they do it for.</p>
<h2>14 inspiring mission statements</h2>
<p>Before creating or updating your organization’s mission statement, take a look at these 14 exceptional mission statements to get your creative juices flowing.</p>
<h3>1. LinkedIn</h3>
<p>“Connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful.”</p>
<p>LinkedIn’s succinct mission statement packs a punch. Not only does LinkedIn want to connect the world’s professionals, it wants to enable them to excel in their careers. Who wouldn’t want to help people do that?</p>
<p>Reading this statement makes employees hopeful and lays out what customers can expect from investing in LinkedIn. Making the mission statement more about the end user, rather than the company itself, underscores LinkedIn’s focus on customer service and customer success.</p>
<h3>2. Patagonia</h3>
<p>“We&#8217;re in business to save our home planet.”</p>
<p>Patagonia subscribes to a triple bottom line 一 they’re just as committed to their employees and environmental concerns as profits 一 and this shines through in their mission statement. This mission statement effectively entices candidates passionate about doing good by doing well to apply. They can then guide the company towards sustainable practices, products, and partners who can catapult its growth while making the world a better place.</p>
<h3>3. Warby Parker</h3>
<p>“To offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses.”</p>
<p>Warby Parker emphasizes corporate social responsibility in their mission statement while making it clear that they also value creativity and quality. By producing great eyewear ethically and selling it for an affordable price, they hope to pave the way for other retail companies to do the same. This unique, inspiring mission encourages employees to be a part of Warby Parker’s journey.</p>
<h3>4. JetBlue</h3>
<p>“To inspire humanity – both in the air and on the ground. We are committed to giving back in meaningful ways in the communities we serve and to inspire others to do the same.”</p>
<p>JetBlue’s mission statement manages to express an expansive sentiment while remaining clear: they want to make an impact on their travelling customers and in the places their customers and employees live. JetBlue made a name for itself as a more service-oriented airline, bringing humanity back to air travel. The hospitality slant to their branding has distinguished them from other airlines, so adding this part of their personality to their mission statement ensures that it’s part of everything they do.</p>
<h3>5. Tesla</h3>
<p>“To accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.”</p>
<p>The use of the word “accelerate” in Tesla’s mission statement is a perfect way to encapsulate their incredible growth over the past several years. Another unique element of this mission statement is Tesla’s self-awareness. Although its clean energy vehicles are out on the market, the company knows that there will be a long road shifting towards sustainable energy. Their mission statement makes the scale of this transition clear while also exciting customers and employees about being a part of change.</p>
<h3>6. TED</h3>
<p>“Spread ideas.”</p>
<p>TED’s mission statement can’t get any shorter or sweeter. In just two words, TED sums up exactly what they are about as a media organization. The signature quick and impactful style that made TED a household name is captured perfectly in their mission statement. Like the mission statement, TED talks are short, sharing ideas in 18 minutes or less. And the openness of the statement makes it feel like anyone can and should share their ideas 一 a central element of TED’s culture.</p>
<h3>7. Disney</h3>
<p>“To entertain, inform, and inspire people around the globe through the power of unparalleled storytelling, reflecting the iconic brands, creative minds, and innovative technologies that make ours the world’s premier entertainment company.”</p>
<p>With so many aspects to their business, it’s no wonder that Disney’s mission statement is a little on the long side. But no matter whether you’re on a Disney cruise, at a Disney theme park, watching a Disney movie, or staying at a Disney resort, you get a theatrical, iconic, entertaining experience. Disney’s whole ethos is about finding new ways to impart moving stories and deliver moments of magic 一 and they’ve accomplished that year after year for decades.</p>
<h3>8. Microsoft</h3>
<p>&#8220;To empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of today’s organizations are tech companies to some degree. But Microsoft isn’t just any tech company, and they’ve got a bold mission statement to prove it. Microsoft has powered innovation for over nearly fifty years, developing platforms that people use day in and day out to achieve their personal and professional aspirations. Their mission statement reflects Microsoft’s belief that innovation can act as a force for good and transform the entire world.</p>
<h3>9. BBC</h3>
<p>&#8220;To act in the public interest, serving all audiences through the provision of impartial, high-quality and distinctive output and services which inform, educate and entertain.”</p>
<p>The BBC is one of the most widely read and viewed media companies in the United Kingdom and has enormous sway over how the public perceives the world around them. It’s no surprise that their mission statement focuses on providing objective information to teach and inspire their audience. And, of course, they couldn’t leave out entertainment. The BBC has created some of the world’s most beloved TV shows and movies, highlighting the diverse communities within the United Kingdom and showcasing the UK’s unique culture and values.</p>
<h3>10. Intel</h3>
<p>“We engineer solutions for our customers’ greatest challenges with reliable, cloud to edge computing, inspired by Moore’s Law.”</p>
<p>One of Intel’s co-founders, Gordon Moore, still has a huge influence on the company, as well as on the entire technology industry. While forming Intel, he observed patterns in chip manufacturing that became the foundation for every tech giant’s supply chain and product strategy: the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, while the cost of computers gets cut in half. Today, Intel remains guided by Moore’s Law. With a specific focus on creating the most cost-effective, advanced devices, Intel has attracted top talent, fine-tuned its operations, and turned into a global powerhouse.</p>
<h3>11. Starbucks</h3>
<p>&#8220;To inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you like coffee, you probably know where the nearest Starbucks is at all times. The sweet aroma of coffee greets you at the door, while the friendly baristas and jazz music create an ambiance that’s hard to beat. And that’s not by accident. Starbucks puts individual customers at the center of its business and, as a result, has become a staple for coffee lovers all over the world. Starbucks also strives to create a sense of community. Starbucks’ mission statement stresses the importance of warmth and connection, and it shines through in the staff members that memorize your order, <a href="https://starbuckssecretmenu.net/puppuccino-starbucks-secret-menu/">give out puppuccinos</a>, and ask you about your day.</p>
<h3>12. American Red Cross</h3>
<p>&#8220;The American Red Cross prevents and alleviates human suffering in the face of emergencies by mobilizing the power of volunteers and the generosity of donors.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the past 140 years, the American Red Cross has been a symbol of hope and safety, providing disaster relief, biomedical services, first aid training, and more. It should come as no surprise that its mission statement alludes to the myriad ways it addresses humanitarian issues at home and abroad. But it can’t accomplish these life-saving feats without the help of volunteers and donors. The American Red Cross’ mission statement not only underscores the need for emergency services across the globe, it also recognizes that its work wouldn’t be possible without the contributions of others. This bold, appreciative mission statement drives both donors and team members to serve and protect those in need.</p>
<h3>13. Toyota</h3>
<p>&#8220;To attract and attain customers with high-valued products and services and the most satisfying ownership experience in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toyota is known for its durable, reliable vehicles, and, judging from the mission statement of its American branch, they plan to keep it that way. Besides implying that they take great pride in producing top-tier cars, Toyota’s mission statement also hints that they are in the business of creating life-long customers. They want to guide clients through every stage of their car-buying journey, serving as a trusted advisor. This strategy has paid off — with so many different cars to choose from and excellent service to boot, Toyotas have become a solid option for customers at any life stage or price point.</p>
<h3>14. IKEA</h3>
<p>“To create a better everyday life for the many people.”</p>
<p>IKEA’s goal is to sell a wide range of products to a wide range of people. Its modular designs and signature styles are a staple of college dorms, family homes, Airbnbs, and more. But IKEA’s products aren’t the only thing getting and keeping them ahead. They distinguish themselves from other furniture stores with their extremely competitive prices. Each of these unique elements is featured prominently in their mission statement, reminding employees and customers that IKEA continues to stay true to its vision.</p>
<h2>How to create your own great mission statement</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve seen a few fantastic mission statements, it’s time to write your own. Doing so can be daunting, but luckily, there are similarities between all great mission statements that you can keep in mind.</p>
<p>The best mission statements are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/5-things-amazing-company-mission-statements-all-have-in-common/">short and punchy</a>. Because mission statements are designed to inspire your employees and move customers, they shouldn’t be hard to remember. And they shouldn’t include jargon that’s difficult to understand.</p>
<p>To maximize the statement’s impact, start with an action verb. After “to,” you’ll often see words like “offer,” “prevent,” “empower,” and “entertain,” demonstrating the organization’s commitment to actually put their vision into practice.</p>
<p>Superb mission statements are specific as well, detailing exactly what the company does and how they do it while connecting to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/company-core-value-examples/">its core values</a>. They address the company’s internal and external impacts, bringing staff, stakeholders, and customers into the equation.</p>
<p>Finally, mission statements aren’t set in stone. The best ones get updated every few years to ensure they accurately represent the company’s current goals and values.</p>
<h2>Put your mission statement into practice</h2>
<p>Developing a powerful mission statement is key to creating a phenomenal organizational culture and employee experience. Team members and customers yearn to feel connected to what your company does. They want to feel like they’re making a positive impact on the world just by working with or buying from your business.</p>
<p>But just writing a great mission statement doesn’t immediately bring about a sense of connection. You need to recognize the staff who follow through on each part of your mission, and listen to employees when they feel that your company and its mission aren’t aligned.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/">Achievers Employee Experience Platform</a> empowers your organization to do just that. Its ecosystem of products make employees feel valued and heard, fostering a feeling of belonging and supporting a winning culture. It comes with <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/">Achievers Recognize</a>, enabling your entire workforce to provide frequent, meaningful recognition to reinforce behavior that aligns with your mission. Recognize even allows employees to redeem hard-earned recognition points for rewards of their choice. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/listen/">Achievers Listen</a>, a state-of-the-art employee engagement platform, uses pulse surveys and and always-on feedback channels to surface and help address problems before they impact your business and its mission.</p>

<p>With the Great Resignation upon us, keeping employees engaged is more important than ever before. But according to Gallup, organizations aren’t meeting this challenge, with 51% of employees reporting that they’re not engaged. This isn’t too surprising, as the factors that drive employee engagement remain mysterious to many companies and HR professionals. Should your organization [&#8230;]</p>

But according to Gallup, organizations aren’t meeting this challenge, with <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/321965/employee-engagement-reverts-back-pre-covid-levels.aspx">51% of employees</a> reporting that they’re not engaged.</p>
<p>This isn’t too surprising, as the factors that drive employee engagement remain mysterious to many companies and HR professionals. Should your organization focus on building a recognition program? Maybe employees would respond more strongly to new wellness initiatives. Or perhaps a series of employee engagement surveys is the best place to start.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/">Download this free report on the state of employee engagement in 2021</a></p>
<p>There’s no need to base your engagement strategy on guesswork. By prioritizing these 12 major drivers of employee engagement, your company can focus its resources where they’ll have the most impact.</p>
<h2>12 ways to drive employee engagement</h2>
<p>All of the engagement drivers below affect how employees perform and their feelings about their peers, leadership, and your organization as a whole. While each of these 12 drivers is impactful on its own, team members all have individual preferences. This means that the best way to boost engagement is with a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">comprehensive employee engagement platform</a> that gives your company the insights it needs to tailor its engagement initiatives to meet your employees’ unique needs.</p>
<p>That said, let’s dive into the 12 major drivers of employee engagement.</p>
<h3>1. Recognition</h3>
<p>Employee recognition is the number one driver of engagement. It’s the best way to make employees feel valued and motivate them to give their all. However, the occasional thank you in the hallway or shoutout in a company meeting isn’t enough to impact engagement.</p>
<p>Instead, look to build an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-program/">organization-wide recognition program</a> that enables frequent social and monetary recognition. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-software/">Use a recognition platform</a> that makes social recognition simple and engaging. It should include mobile capabilities that let employees show appreciation from anywhere and allow interaction with others’ recognitions by commenting, liking, and boosting them with additional reward points. All employees accumulate these points on a regular basis and can award them to other team members. These team members can then redeem the points for rewards that they actually want, rather than another one-size-fits-all gift they don’t know what to do with.</p>
<h3>2. Feedback</h3>
<p>It’s hard to effectively drive engagement without gathering input from employees themselves. Team members want to share ideas for how your organization can improve by <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">expressing their true voice</a> without fear of judgment. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">Ninety percent of workers</a> say they are more likely to stay at a company that collects and acts on feedback. And employees who feel heard by leaders are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2020/04/30/when-you-need-to-revamp-company-culture-and-how-to-do-it/?sh=378a89841399">4.6 times more likely to feel empowered to do their best work</a>.</p>
<p>Companies need an always-on feedback tool that surfaces insights to managers in real time. Implementing an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">employee engagement platform</a> that makes soliciting frequent feedback easy and helps managers <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-action-plans/">act quickly on that feedback</a> is an engagement game changer. These tools let you collect honest input with anonymous channels like <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">pulse surveys</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/hr-chatbots/">always-on, intelligent HR chatbots</a>. You can then <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">analyze the results</a> with tools like intuitive reporting dashboards and heat maps that show you where you should focus your efforts at a glance.</p>
<h3>3. Culture</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/organizational-culture-definition/">Organizational culture</a> has a huge impact on employee engagement. A dysfunctional culture can make even the most self-motivated workers apathetic. When employees feel like outsiders at their own company, disengagement and turnover are never far away. From the CEO to the most junior employee, everyone should understand and believe in why and how your organization does what it does.</p>
<p>Culture change doesn’t happen overnight, but <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/changing-organizational-culture-cultural-change/">it is achievable</a>. Define your vision clearly, make discrete changes to advance toward the culture you want to see, and adjust your approach as needed based on employee feedback. Continue to prioritize the foundations of a great culture like trust, recognition, and diversity, and your organization will be well on its way to creating a truly exceptional company culture.</p>
<h3>4. Team</h3>
<p>You know you’re on a good team when you love coming to work and know that you perform better with your peers around. Cooperative, helpful, conscientious, and inspiring colleagues drive engagement across the organization. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/diverse-teams-at-work/">Cultivate a diverse workforce</a> made up of <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/building-a-team-of-true-team-players/">true team players</a> and engage in <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/10-fun-games-for-team-building/">team building activities</a> to keep connections strong. Even in today’s world of remote work, there are plenty of ways to help teams stay connected, from brief virtual coffee chats to full on organization-wide events held online.</p>
<h3>5. Empowerment</h3>
<p>Without the necessary tools and resources to succeed — and an environment they can thrive in — it’s easy for employees to feel defeated and helpless. How can you <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-empowerment/">empower employees</a> from their first day? It starts with the basics: ensure they have the time, technology, personnel support, and other resources their position requires. But true empowerment means more than allocating resources and letting employees have at it. Provide employees with opportunities for growth, the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/managers-as-coaches/">coaching and training</a> needed to realize their potential, and tangible proof that their voice matters. This <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/building-trust-workplace/">establishes the trust</a> between employees and your organization that serves as the foundation for an engaged workforce.</p>
<h3>6. Development</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/5-ways-to-improve-your-training-and-development-program/">Professional development</a> is worth the investment. Giving employees the option to take online courses, enroll in an MBA program, or listen to a seminar featuring an expert in the industry demonstrates that your company is invested in their long term success. Of course, these opportunities should be something employees are excited about rather than a burden on top of their usual duties. To ensure you’re providing employees with opportunities they actually value, collect and act on their feedback regarding your training initiatives, and adapt those initiatives to changes in your organization and industry.</p>
<h3>7. Work-life balance</h3>
<p>Burnout is an engagement killer, and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/burnout-job/">avoiding it should be a top priority</a>. Preserve employees’ work-life balance so they have the time they need to recharge and handle other responsibilities, from social commitments to taking care of their children. Flexible schedules, additional time off, and ensuring responsibilities are delegated equally throughout the organization are all key parts of preserving work-life balance. And <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-wellness-programs/">developing employee wellness initiatives</a> helps team members stay emotionally and physically healthy both on and off the job.</p>
<h3>8. Expectations</h3>
<p>You can’t perform well when you don’t know what’s expected of you. Poor communication from managers and a lack of feedback leaves many employees confused and disgruntled, robbing them of opportunities to succeed and improve every day. Train leaders at all levels to clearly communicate goals, keep expectations reasonable, and maintain transparency at all times — <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/information-sharing-why-transparency-and-communication-are-crucial-in-a-crisis/">even in a crisis</a>.</p>
<h3>9. Purpose</h3>
<p>Few things engage employees like a mission they believe in. With a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/company-core-value-examples/">set of company values</a> that employees find meaningful, team members will associate their day-to-day tasks with a higher purpose and stay motivated. Company values need to be more than just words to accomplish this, however. When your organization and its leadership live your values day in and day out, employees will follow suit.</p>
<h3>10. Role</h3>
<p>When your role doesn’t match your interests, skills, or experience, it’s hard to stay engaged. But when your job is a perfect fit, success follows naturally. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/why-you-should-identify-your-employees-intrinsic-and-extrinsic-motivators/">Double down on intrinsic motivation</a> by giving employees the positions and responsibilities they crave to realize the benefits of an engaged workforce. Even if it takes the form of shadowing or a gradual shift, giving team members a taste of something they’re passionate about can make all the difference.</p>
<h3>11. Manager support</h3>
<p>Ever had a boss who pushed back on your ideas, denied your PTO requests, or messaged you at all hours of the night? You probably started looking for a job elsewhere. Manager-employee relationships are a key part of the engagement equation. In fact, <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236570/employees-lot-managers.aspx">Gallup found</a> that managers account for 70% of the variance in employee engagement scores. Encourage and train managers to recognize their direct reports frequently, coach rather than micromanage, and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/feedback-for-managers/">truly listen to and act on employees’ concerns and needs</a>.</p>
<h3>12. Leadership and strategy</h3>
<p>The impact of leadership on engagement goes beyond the managerial level. After all, it’s not easy to feel engaged when you don’t believe in where your company is headed or the leadership that’s guiding it. From practicing transparency when making key decisions to championing recognition throughout the organization, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/6-ways-leadership-can-build-a-positive-culture/">leaders should serve as examples</a> that everyone wants to follow.</p>
<h2>Drive employee engagement to new heights</h2>
<p>Employee engagement elevates performance and boosts your company’s bottom line. Now is the time to take control of engagement at your organization and implement an employee engagement platform that can put these drivers to work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/listen/">Achievers Listen</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/">Achievers Recognize</a> — two core parts of the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/">Achievers Employee Experience Platform</a> — are designed to drive engagement at any company and are built on decades of academic and business research along with real-world experience.

Unfortunately, your boss barely took notice. You got a brief shoutout in a team meeting, and that was it. That’s a real blow to morale after a full decade of service, isn’t it? Lackluster work anniversary celebrations are an all-too-common experience for employees. Failure to recognize big milestones leads to lower morale, engagement, and retention.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to recognizing employee work anniversaries than simply sending an email or giving a brief shoutout in a meeting. Creating meaningful anniversary celebrations can be done in a variety of ways — from fostering new experiences to giving meaningful gifts. Here’s a look at the true importance of recognizing employee anniversaries together with 14 great ways to celebrate anniversaries at your organization.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/e-books/the-case-for-employee-recognition/">Download the free guide to building a business case for employee recognition.</a></p>
<h2>Why work anniversaries matter</h2>
<p>Team members expect their employer to remember work milestones. But recognizing work anniversaries involves more than just marking important dates on the calendar — anniversaries give organizations a chance to really make an impact. Showing appreciation in meaningful ways can help boost your company’s <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/shift-years-service-awards-culture-recognition/">culture of recognition</a> and make employees feel valued in the workplace.</p>
<p>Work anniversaries give a prime opportunity to show genuine appreciation for someone’s efforts over the years. As much as they’re about looking back on accomplishment, they’re also about looking <em>forward</em>. Anniversaries are a time to celebrate the relationships an employee has made and the work they’ve done, as well as to show that your organization is invested in and excited for their future successes.</p>
<h2>14 ways to celebrate work anniversaries</h2>
<p>Want to commemorate a milestone but don’t know where to start? Here are 14 ways to celebrate work anniversaries that will delight your employees.</p>
<h3>1. Reward points</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-software/">With a recognition platform</a>, employees accumulate points over time that they can then award to others. The recipient can redeem their points for rewards they choose themselves from a wide-ranging selection. It’s a system that makes it easy to reward employees for accomplishments both big and small, and it especially comes in handy during anniversaries. It streamlines the process of providing a personalized reward to employees — after all, nothing is more personal than something you choose yourself — and allows all other team members to easily join in the celebration by providing additional reward points together with their messages of congratulations.</p>
<h3>2. Give employees a voice</h3>
<p>Employees who have been at a company for a long time have unique institutional knowledge and insights on the business’ long-term evolution. Giving them a seat at the table that they might not normally have is a valuable reward for a big milestone. Of course, only allowing team members to provide input once in a blue moon isn’t likely to thrill them, so work to make <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">employee voice</a> part of employees’ everyday experience to get the most out of this suggestion. Give everyone on your team a chance to voice their concerns and ideas <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">through regular surveys</a> and then <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-action-plans/">take action on their feedback</a> to help improve conditions at your company and show team members that their voices truly do matter.</p>
<h3>3. Public shoutouts</h3>
<p>Social recognition goes a long way for accomplishments big and small. But for more monumental milestones, try going beyond the typical pat on the back or brief acknowledgement in a meeting. A public shoutout, such as posting a congratulations on your organization’s social media or an internal company news feed, boosts employees’ self esteem and sense of accomplishment. It also encourages others to acknowledge the employee’s milestone on their own.</p>
<h3>4. Professional growth opportunities</h3>
<p>When employees reach a big milestone, it’s important to not only show that you value the work they’ve done, but the work they have yet to do. Consider making an investment in their future to show your organization’s gratitude. Whether paying for a certification they’ve always wanted or even supporting their pursuit of another degree, there are few forms of appreciation more significant than those that deal with professional growth. Discussing future career growth opportunities is also a great way to show commitment to helping the team member grow together with your company.</p>
<h3>5. Delicious food</h3>
<p>You can’t go wrong with tasty treats. Whether it’s takeout from your employee’s favorite restaurant or a smorgasbord of desserts that everyone contributed for the big day, food always ties a celebration together. If bringing food into the office isn’t an ideal option, consider taking the employee out for a meal — perhaps with their boss or your company’s CEO. Or if the employee works remotely, send them a basket of their favorite snacks together with a gift card for their favorite restaurant.</p>
<h3>6. Charitable donations</h3>
<p>Sometimes, employees don’t need or want any physical rewards to mark a milestone. Instead, offer to donate to an organization of their choice and give them the choice to make a real difference in the world on their anniversary. This option is even easier with a recognition solution that includes charitable options when redeeming points.</p>
<h3>7. Time to volunteer</h3>
<p>Similarly, an employee might want to do something charitable for their work anniversary by donating their time instead of or in addition to making a monetary gift. Giving team members paid time off to volunteer is a win-win. Employees get an extra day off to do something fulfilling, and your organization boosts its presence in the community.</p>
<h3>8. Time off</h3>
<p>Giving your employee time off, such as a few days of extra PTO or even the opportunity to take a sabbatical, provides them with valuable time to recharge and celebrate on their own time. It shows that you’re not just invested in what that employee accomplishes in the workplace but also their physical and mental wellness over the long term.</p>
<h3>9. Handwritten messages</h3>
<p>Taking time to put your appreciation into words means a lot to employees, but it’s easy to forget to share words of thanks during the average, busy workday. Team members want validation from their bosses to know that they’re doing a good job, but they don’t always know how to ask for it. Take the time to include a handwritten note of thanks together with the other ways your organization is showing thanks. You can even leverage an employee recognition platform to create a card filled with customized messages of gratitude from team members across the organization.</p>
<h3>10. Hold a party or ceremony</h3>
<p>Office parties are a classic option for commemorating milestones. They’re ubiquitous for good reason. Gathering for a celebration is a great way to get everyone on the team involved in lifting up a colleague on their big day. Even if most or all of your employees are remote, gathering virtually is a great way to create a sense of community and connection.</p>
<h3>11. Meaningful experiences</h3>
<p>Want to ensure an employee will always remember a certain milestone? Provide them with an experience they’ll always remember, whether that takes the form of tickets to an in-person or virtual concert for their favorite band or covering a trip to the best restaurant in town. Of course, providing an experience that the employee will actually value and enjoy is key, and the scale of the experience should be commensurate with the importance of the milestone.</p>
<h3>12. Branded swag</h3>
<p>Branded swag might be a bit cliche, but if the item’s value matches the milestone you’re commemorating and the employee actually wants it, going this route can still be a great choice. For example, let’s say you have an employee who really enjoys golf and just celebrated ten years at your company. A customized set of clubs with the company logo would make a great gift, while a pack of company-branded pens is exactly what your organization should avoid.</p>
<h3>13. A bonus or raise</h3>
<p>Compensating your employees for a big milestone is an effective way to show recognition. And financial rewards <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-incentive-programs/">come in a variety of forms</a> beyond just cutting an extra check on payday. Tuition reimbursement, extra PTO, and giving the employee the option to buy into your company are all worthwhile incentives that team members appreciate.</p>
<h3>14. Funds for the home office</h3>
<p>With more teams working remotely these days, it’s important to provide incentives that can be accessed from anywhere. Providing a stipend for home office upgrades is a flexible gift appropriate for both big and small milestones. If someone has been around for one or two years, you might offer to buy them that new office chair they’ve had their eye on. If they’re celebrating 10 years, try offering them something bigger, like an adjustable desk or a new work computer.</p>
<h2>How to make work anniversaries special</h2>
<p>Regardless of how you choose to celebrate work milestones, follow these four best practices to create memorable anniversary experiences.</p>
<h3>1. Recognize each and every milestone</h3>
<p>Employees notice when you forget a date that means something to them. Whether they’re celebrating their first year at your company, 40 years of service, or even their birthday, it’s essential to take the time to acknowledge these milestones — even the smaller ones.</p>
<p>The easiest way to remember important dates for everyone on your team is to write them down. Start by building out a calendar that lists everyone’s upcoming milestones. And consider delegating the task of tracking these important dates to an appropriate team member so that they can send out a reminder when a milestone is approaching.</p>
<h3>2. Don&#8217;t neglect social recognition</h3>
<p>Praise from peers is a crucial part of celebrating anniversaries. Rewards can mean a lot, but <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/social-recognition-what-why-and-how/">social recognition is the key</a> to building and strengthening relationships. The most important part of social recognition is to make it genuine. A brief shoutout from a team leader reading a message word-for-word off a screen may come off as lazy or unprepared. Instead, express appreciation for specific projects or contributions and encourage the whole team to chime in, preferably with an employee recognition platform they’re all using already.</p>
<h3>3. Go above and beyond for the big milestones</h3>
<p>The recognition you choose for an employee anniversary should match the importance of that milestone. For example, sending a simple card to a team member who just reached 25 years of service might come off as inconsiderate. But a card combined with additional recognition, like a ceremony at the office and a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-rewards-ideas/">personalized reward</a>, would be a memorable and appropriate gesture.</p>
<h3>4. Make employee anniversaries the tip of the recognition iceberg</h3>
<p>Remembering and recognizing major milestones is just the start to making a lasting impression on employees. Organizations that want to build a real culture of recognition and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/">reap the rewards</a> should make it easy for all team members to show appreciation on a daily basis. As mentioned above, a recognition solution is the fastest way to get employees across the company involved. When everyone is able to share social recognition and even provide monetary rewards — in the form of redeemable points accumulated each month — anniversary celebrations become part of a cohesive recognition experience rather than an exception to the norm.</p>
<h2>Provide great recognition for work anniversaries and beyond</h2>
<p>Taking time to plan meaningful recognition for employee anniversaries is an important part of supporting your organization’s employees and investing in their future success. But it shouldn’t stop there. A real culture of recognition means that employees don’t have to wait for the big dates to receive appreciation.</p>
<p>The easiest way to make recognition a routine practice is to invest in a recognition platform. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/">Achievers Recognize</a> is a science-backed, award-winning recognition solution that makes showing appreciation an engaging, smooth experience. Employees can provide recognition anywhere, anytime thanks to the platform’s mobile capabilities. And the ability to interact with others’ messages of recognition, together with a points-based rewards system, keeps the recognition experience engaging. Team members even have access to hundreds of rewards that are sure to please all tastes and suit every milestone.</p>

<p>This year at ACE 2021, a group of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I) experts gathered virtually for a frank discussion led by Achievers Customer Success Manager, Wayne Wiley, on the state of DE&amp;I in organizations today and the way forward for better inclusivity.</p>
<p>The conversation centered around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting started and overcoming obstacles</li>
<li>Building and sustaining positive momentum</li>
<li>Measuring success</li>
<li>The crucial role of recognition in nurturing a sense of belonging, and</li>
<li>How to create a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture</li>
</ul>
<h2>The starting point: DE&amp;I advocates and experts weigh in</h2>
<p>During their 60-minute open discussion, three panelists discussed what led them to their current roles as DE&amp;I leaders within their respective organizations. For each of them, a common thread emerged — a lived experience and an innate desire to support equality in both their personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>For panelist Katrina (KT) Thornton, Senior Director, Global Equity, Diversity, and Inclusions at Kellogg, 2020 was the year that ignited new DE&amp;I awareness and propelled the advancement of inclusivity initiatives within organizations globally. “It was a very intentional year — not just by the numbers, but by the practices that drove a culture shift,” reflected Katrina.</p>
<p>Co-panelist, Thaiz Chanman, VP, People Experience and Organizational Effectiveness, Remitly (formerly a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Leader at Amazon) echoed similar sentiments. She noted that many organizations took 2020 as an opportunity to reflect and renew their focus on DE&amp;I, and to take new initiatives that would drive change.</p>
<p>Marcos Pesquera, the Systems Vice-President, Community Benefit, Healthy Equity, Diversity and Inclusions at CHRISTUS Health spoke about how he draws on his previous experience in healthcare to help the organization drive positive DE&amp;I change — something that’s often easier said than done. “Your resilience muscle needs to be well developed,” he said. “You represent everyone, not just those who agree with you. Try to remain neutral and comfortable with incremental progress.”</p>
<p>Marco’s top three pieces of advice for DE&amp;I advocates beginning their organization’s journey:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect what you’re doing with the organization’s mission — <em>Why is it important? </em></li>
<li>Have a direct line of communication to the CEO with regular meetings to move initiatives forward and remove barriers</li>
<li>Represent all sides and remain neutral</li>
</ol>
<p>“See yourself as a culture architect. Share your experience and encourage others to do the same,” suggested Thaiz. “There is power in the stories you have to tell.” Each of the Achievers panelists agreed that being an agent of change requires weaving DE&amp;I through all that they do and taking every opportunity to have the conversation, no matter how difficult, to move the needle towards positive change.</p>
<h2>Overcoming expected (and unanticipated) obstacles</h2>
<p>Passion may be the driver that helps you succeed, but you will no doubt encounter obstacles to change within any organization. To be effective, Katrina suggests developing other key competencies within your skill set, including:</p>
<p><strong>Courage:</strong> As a general rule, 1/3 of individuals will be excited by new DE&amp;I initiatives, 1/3 won’t believe in it, and 1/3 will be afraid or unsure of how to engage. Your role is to clearly articulate concepts to each of these distinct groups, with the goal of nurturing alignment and advancement.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural intelligence:</strong> Continue to gut-check your motives. DE&amp;I is a hot topic today but requires a great deal of ongoing behind the scenes work to continually challenge your organization to do (and be) better.</p>
<p><strong>Walk the talk:</strong> It goes without saying that you must lead privately what you preach publicly. Stay the course and stay true to your guiding principles no matter who is (or isn’t) looking.</p>
<h2>Tools and systems to get you there</h2>
<p>Employee resource groups provide the bedrock of safe spaces where employees can share their stories and become allies. More than just a social club, these forums help people connect, leverage their diversity, and support the organization in it’s DE&amp;I evolution.</p>
<p>Tactically, surveys are another key tool for gathering and actioning employee feedback around DE&amp;I. For instance, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/listen/">Achievers Listen<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>, part of the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/">Achievers Employee Experience Platform<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> not only provides a summary of employee sentiment, it helps leaders take immediate action on hot button issues as well as plan and execute longer-term initiatives to drive sustainable change — an invaluable tool for those focused on DE&amp;I.</p>
<p>We know that feeling heard and included helps to nurture a sense of belonging, which correlates positively with productivity, job satisfaction, culture fit, and sense of purpose. In fact, belonging strongly correlates with every positive behavior or sentiment that was surveyed for in Achievers’ <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-culture-of-belonging/">2021 Culture Report</a>. Frequent real-time pulse surveys are a great way to keep pace with the sense of belonging within your organization and to course-correct your DE&amp;I initiatives as needed.</p>
<p>It’s also important to have a central location in which all your resources and supporting communications are stored and updated — readily accessible to all employees, whether they’re in-office or accessing via mobile. The <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/">Achievers Employee Experience Platform<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> acts as a single source for recognition, rewards, and gathering your employee voice. It’s also a resource hub for your employees and a communication channel, removing barriers by providing equitable access and support across your workforce, no matter where they work.</p>
<h2>The role of recognition</h2>
<p>Combining recognition with diversity and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/the-importance-of-inclusion-in-the-workplace/">inclusion</a> efforts can triple the likelihood of achieving your DE&amp;I objectives. For many leaders, it’s <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/videos/the-missing-piece-of-d-and-i/">the missing piece of their DE&amp;I puzzle</a>. The Achievers Workforce Institute’s <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-di-insights-report/">2021 D&amp;I Insights Report</a> outlines why organizations who align their DE&amp;I efforts with their recognition strategy see improved results for both programs.</p>
<p>In the report, we learn that this integration drives significant feelings of inclusion and belonging that lead to greater employee satisfaction and business outcomes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2x as many employees feel a strong sense of inclusion at companies where recognition incorporates DE&amp;I</strong></p>
<p>Quick tips to integrate D&amp;I with recognition and rewards:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bring your programs together:</strong> unite leaders of both programs to discover how each set of initiatives can work together</li>
<li><strong>Add recognition to existing DE&amp;I initiatives:</strong> Encourage employees to recognize DE&amp;I efforts among their peers</li>
<li><strong>Create DE&amp;I recognition opportunities:</strong> Consider adding a recognition specific to DE&amp;I into your program</li>
<li><strong>Use recognition data to assess DE&amp;I trends:</strong> Achievers’ data science team helps organization identify key data, such as language trends, to understand and address nuances in how certain groups recognize which in turn informs recognition training programs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Creating a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture</h2>
<p>At a moment when many organizations are putting out public statements, our ACE 2021 DE&amp;I session panelists emphasized that it is time to put talk aside and to demonstrate action. Accountability is key. Our internal customers (employees) come first, but we also have to be sure to show our external customers what we are doing as organizations to recognize and address inequalities. This includes being open to potentially uncomfortable conversations, and an understanding that action is critical.</p>
<p>Here is a list of quick tips from our panelists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognize and address all audiences and perspectives: Employees, business, and community</li>
<li>Don’t get stuck in neutral, but recognize that progress takes time</li>
<li>Incorporate a holistic approach with all that you do</li>
<li>Balance the qualitative with the quantitative</li>
<li>Embrace your opponents and bring others into the conversationThe work that DE&amp;I specialists are doing today is difficult, complex, and challenging. It’s also rewarding. It isn’t about dividing people into groups. It’s about promoting unity and inclusivity. It’s an endeavor that organizations everywhere are undertaking, each at different stages of their journey.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let <a href="https://www.achievers.com/">Achievers</a> be your ally as you work to progress diversity, equity, and inclusion within your organization. Listen to the ACE 2021 <a href="https://www.achievers.com/ace/">DE&amp;I session on-demand</a> then continue the conversation with one of our employee experience experts.</p>

If employees don’t feel safe, valued, and challenged at your organization, you’re just giving them the extra nudge they need to leave. If you instead treat employees with respect, appreciate their individuality, and give them the flexibility they need, they’re much more likely to stick around.</p>
<p>Getting culture right is a must for every organization, but it’s hard to know where to start. To get your creative juices flowing, take a look at these great examples of how companies across industries have built cultures that engaged their employees and led to business success.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-culture-of-belonging/">Discover how to build a culture where all employees feel welcome</a></p>
<h3>1. Patagonia</h3>
<p>If you’ve ever researched corporate social responsibility, you’re probably familiar with <a href="https://www.patagonia.ca/home/">Patagonia</a>. They pride themselves on their commitment to bettering the planet, and they’ve set themselves apart from other companies in terms of sustainability. Patagonia also <a href="https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/how-can-patagonia-have-only-4-percent-worker-turnover-hint-they-pay-activist-employees-bail.html">boasts incredibly low turnover</a>. So how do they do it? Strong, straightforward core values and devotion to their unique talent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patagonia.com/core-values/">Patagonia’s core values</a> include ‘build the best product’, ‘cause no unnecessary harm,’ and ‘use business to protect nature&#8217;. All three of these values are simple and easy to understand while relating to Patagonia’s lofty goal of improving the environment. Building the best product means Patagonia employees always think of ways to serve consumers better while making their products last longer. Causing no unnecessary harm means Patagonia team members take the time to source the best, safest materials to use and pursue projects that do more good. And using business to protect nature means Patagonia encourages its employees to identify and act on pressing environmental issues in the world. These core values attract thoughtful, interesting candidates who <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/culture-alignment-techniques-that-drive-business-performance/">align well with Patagonia’s culture</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://mastersinvest.com/newblog/2020/9/8/learning-from-yvon-chouinard">Patagonia’s founder, Yvon Chouinard, states</a> that they actively seek people “who love to spend as much time as possible in the mountains or the wild&#8221;. As such, Patagonia recruiters don’t find candidates through typical avenues, relying instead on <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/culture.html">informal networks and other unconventional hiring strategies</a>. Talent teams <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-connect/ways-patagonia-built-ridiculous-culture">read resumes from the bottom up</a>, looking for clues of adventurousness in a candidate’s volunteer work, interests, and activities before reviewing their experience and skills. To keep these outdoorsy employees happy, Patagonia has a slew of perks, including 2-month paid volunteer trips with an environmental organization as a first year anniversary gift and onsite childcare centers with bilingual programs.</p>
<p>Patagonia’s focus on their employees and the environment has paid off: it’s making around <a href="https://thecorrespondent.com/424/the-more-patagonia-rejects-consumerism-the-more-the-brand-sells/56126501376-a30f2daa">$1 billion in sales per year</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Southwest</h3>
<p>What comes to mind when you think of Southwest? If you’re like most people, it’s probably the friendly flight attendants and their funny quips before takeoff. Guess what? That’s not an accident. Southwest is known for its superb culture that urges employees to freely express themselves and embrace their sense of humor. And happy employees create a better flight experience for consumers, directly tying into Southwest’s vision “<a href="https://careers.southwestair.com/culture">to be the world&#8217;s most loved, most efficient, and most profitable airline.</a>”</p>
<p>To uphold their exceptional culture and to continue delivering outstanding experiences for their customers, Southwest emphasizes appreciation, recognition, and celebration. They take these principles seriously, <a href="https://www.humansynergistics.com/blog/culture-university/details/culture-university/2018/05/29/southwest-airlines-reveals-5-culture-lessons">taking tasks off of flight crews’ hands</a> in what are called “Cultural Blitzes“ and organizing company wide Spirit Parties and Southwest Rallies. Not only that, Southwest also recognizes and hosts celebrations for big life events and milestones, making employees feel seen and appreciated.</p>
<p>As Southwest founder, Herb Kelleher, <a href="https://www.logomaker.com/blog/2012/05/21/9-inspirational-quotes-on-business-by-herb-kelleher/">once said of competitors</a>, “they can buy all the physical things. The things you can’t buy are dedication, devotion, loyalty 一 the feeling that you are participating in a crusade.”</p>
<h3>3. Pixar</h3>
<p>It’s hard to think of a Pixar film that was a flop. Movies like Toy Story, Up, A Bug’s Life, Cars, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles are celebrated for their beautiful animation and delightful storytelling. Pixar’s unparalleled track record can be attributed in part to its strong culture.</p>
<p>In a creative field, you rarely have an excellent first draft. But the whole point of a draft is to have something to work from. Pixar co-founder, Ed Catmull, realized this and encouraged <a href="https://valota.live/learn-from-the-best-how-to-mimic-pixars-culture-of-innovation/">getting comfortable sharing unfinished work</a>. This discourages perfectionism and lessens any embarrassment employees might feel, allowing them to think more creatively. Another element of creativity is promoting collaboration and teamwork. Catmull recommends knocking down department silos. Red tape stifles creativity and limits communication, putting a damper on quality. Instead, Pixar ran daily meetings (“dailies”) that provided channels for regular feedback and established “brain trusts” of directors and other leaders who <a href="https://legalconnect.com/developing-a-culture-of-innovation-lessons-learned-from-pixars-co-founder/">pushed movie teams towards creative excellence</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Google</h3>
<p><a href="https://about.google/">Google’s “mission</a> is to organize the world&#8217;s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” This lofty goal resonates with employees and drives them forward. Besides the fact that Googlers have the company’s vision memorized, Google also sets itself apart in its now-classic “<a href="https://about.google/philosophy/">ten things we know to be true</a>” core values. These values reinforce the concepts of doing good, working fast, and delivering excellent service.</p>
<p>Google also has big goals when it comes to sustainability. Its mission is to foster sustainability at scale is progressing well 一 Google has been carbon neutral since 2007 and <a href="https://sustainability.google/">aims to be carbon-free by 2030</a>. Google also makes a positive impact by funding technology projects that push us towards a greener future.</p>
<p>That said, attracting the same level of phenomenal talent and maintaining a diverse workforce while going through periods of immense growth and change is difficult. In fact, Google’s culture has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/31/google-veterans-the-company-has-become-unrecognizable.html">faced headwinds in recent years</a>, demonstrating that you can never rest on your laurels when it comes to company culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/culture-alignment-techniques-that-drive-business-performance/">Explore the cultural alignment techniques that drive business performance</a></p>
<h3>5. Zappos</h3>
<p>Zappos is renowned for its unrivaled customer service. But although that’s a high priority, Zappos has recognized that <a href="https://www.zappos.com/about/why-culture-matters">their company culture matters even more</a>. They believe that customer service, branding, and performance will fall into place with the right culture. Zappos also adopted a “Holacracy” policy in 2013, empowering employees to organize themselves and make decisions usually left to management.</p>
<p>Zappos is committed to its core values and lives them out every day. And these aren’t your typical company values. Instead, <a href="https://www.zappos.com/about/what-we-live-by">they consist of statements</a> like “Create Fun and A Little Weirdness,” “Deliver WOW Through Service,” and “Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded.” Zappos believes in its way of doing business so much that it’s created <a href="https://www.zapposinsights.com/">Zappos Insights</a>, a group that evangelizes Zappos’ culture worldwide. </p>
<h3>6. Warby Parker</h3>
<p>Warby Parker is the epitome of looking good and doing good at the same time. It’s grown to 1,400 employees in less than a decade by <a href="https://ca.warbyparker.com/culture">offering an alternative</a> to “overpriced and underwhelming eyewear&#8221;. Warby Parker gives back to communities across the globe in the form of basic eye exams and glasses. And it’s one of the only carbon-neutral eyewear brands.</p>
<p>How did Warby Parker create its winning culture? Cofounders David Gilboa and Neil Blumenthal developed a <a href="https://jilt.com/blog/warby-parker-culture/">training and onboarding system</a> to teach new hires about how Warby Parker came to be and where it’s going in the future. Warby Parker also commends employees for giving direct feedback, encourages openness and trust, and supports strong connections between team members. On their first day, new hires are welcomed to a desk full of balloons, and current employees make a point to come up and introduce themselves. As Gilboa says, “<a href="https://review.firstround.com/how-warby-parker-makes-every-point-in-its-employee-lifecycle-extraordinary">You have to make people feel special and welcome from the very first moment they interact with your organization</a>.”</p>
<h3>7. Spotify</h3>
<p>Spotify has learned to embrace the uncertainty of the ever-evolving music industry while unlocking innovation in its employees and the creators they support. This stems from their <a href="https://www.lifeatspotify.com/being-here">five core values</a>: innovative, sincere, passionate, collaborative, and playful. Taking big risks and entertaining what were crazy ideas at first has paid dividends. Today, Spotify is a household name, has over 8 million creators on its platform, and continues to release viral features, like the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/12/spotify-wrapped-and-data-collection/577930/">beloved annual “Spotify Wrapped” tool</a>.</p>
<p>Their innovative nature extends even to how they communicate their core values, in the form of a “<a href="https://www.lifeatspotify.com/being-here/the-band-manifesto">Band Manifesto</a>.” Even their careers webpage has an untraditional name, “<a href="https://www.lifeatspotify.com/being-here/grow-with-us">Grow With Us</a>,” and it refers to managers as those who lead the Band.</p>
<p>Of course, working at Spotify isn’t just about making band puns. Employees have to innovate quickly to stay ahead of the competition. Like a typical software company, Spotify uses a form of agile development, aptly called the <a href="https://medium.com/serious-scrum/spotify-engineering-culture-spotify-model-an-introduction-500837f04010">Spotify Model</a>. In it, autonomous teams of eight or fewer people are responsible for the end-to-end design and maintenance of one part of the Spotify ecosystem. They can make fast decisions without waiting on higher-ups or other teams. These squads are nimble, making small releases in order to fail, learn, and improve fast.</p>
<h3>8. Netflix</h3>
<p>Netflix has become a cornerstone of American culture. From memes of original shows and documentaries to relaxing on a weekday evening, Netflix touches many of our everyday lives. While that’s terrific for Netflix’s bottom line, it brings with it the demand for more and better entertainment. Teams at Netflix know how much their work has contributed to the world’s happiness, and they’ve created what they call an <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">“amazing and unusual” culture</a> to keep their stream of quality content going.</p>
<p>Some hallmarks of Netflix’s culture are its high expectations, candidness, and accountability. And they don’t mince words. As Patty McCord, former Chief Talent Officer, puts it, Netflix has “<a href="https://review.firstround.com/The-woman-behind-the-Netflix-Culture-doc">a built-in expectation of high performance, radical honesty, and the motto ‘we’re not family’</a>.” They hold employees to high standards, employing what’s called “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettonputter/2018/12/04/netflixs-company-culture-is-not-for-everybody-and-thats-exactly-how-it-should-be/?sh=5ef4696a1880">keeper tests</a>” in their review cycle to force managers to say whether they would fight to retain their direct reports. While this may seem counterintuitive, it’s meant to weed out people who aren’t up to the challenge.</p>
<p>For all its toughness, Netflix is also known for the flexibility and freedom it gives its employees. After all, one of their philosophies is “people over process.” With this combination, Netflix has created a one-of-a-kind culture and organization.</p>

A startling <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">82% of employees</a> wish they received more recognition for their efforts.

<p>Not sure where to start? Here are seven valuable employee behaviors that should be recognition priorities at every organization.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-state-of-recognition-report/">Download Achievers’ State of Recognition Report</a></p>
<h2>7 employee behaviors organizations should recognize</h2>
<p>Recognizing and showing appreciation encourages employees to repeat behaviors that are essential to success at your organization. Here are seven behaviors you should recognize to take your recognition program to the next level.</p>
<h3>1. Providing and acting on feedback</h3>
<p>Offering pulse surveys and other easy-to-use employee feedback channels is a great way to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">give your employees a strong voice</a> within your organization. When employees provide input, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">you should quickly act on it</a> — and recognize them for doing so to ensure a steady stream of key insights. As employee feedback should be anonymous, this is best done with a recognition platform that automatically and confidentially provides reward points.</p>
<h3>2. Passing recognition on</h3>
<p>The best organizations give every employee the ability to recognize positive behavior in real time, and they reward those who provide recognition to others. This is a great way to keep the cycle of appreciation going and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/changing-organizational-culture-cultural-change/">cultivate an engaged, grateful team culture</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Pursuing opportunities for learning and development</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/5-reasons-create-culture-learning-organization/">Creating a culture of learning</a> at your organization keeps employees motivated as they look forward to trying out new skills and taking on new responsibilities. Encourage leaders and peers to frequently recognize and reward team members for their learning and development accomplishments, whether it’s getting certified in a new skill or being awarded a long-sought degree.</p>
<h3>4. Collaborating with others</h3>
<p>You may have talented, motivated, and creative employees at your organization, but they can’t reach their full potential without the help of their fellow team members. Make sure that everyone at your company recognizes great collaboration whenever it happens.</p>
<h3>5. Living your culture</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/organizational-culture-definition/">Your organizational culture</a> is created by the values, expectations, and practices that guide the daily actions of all team members. It’s what makes your company unique, successful, and a great place to work. Your culture needs to be more than a few inspirational terms —  team members should live it through consistent, authentic behaviors. So when team members engage in the actions that you want to define your culture, recognize them for it. Before long, you’ll notice that your company culture <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/culture-alignment-techniques-that-drive-business-performance/">better aligns with the ideal everyone is striving for</a>.</p>
<h3>6. Growing from mistakes</h3>
<p>Mistakes happen every day at all levels of any organization. Although it’s tough to confront errors head on, they’ll only repeat again and again if <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/giving-employee-feedback/">employees don’t receive feedback</a>. Have a productive discussion about how the mistake happened, how to deal with the impact, and how to prevent similar errors in the future. When employees act on feedback and show growth, recognize them to motivate the entire team to improve their performance.</p>
<h3>7. Showing reliability</h3>
<p>Even the most successful organizations will experience difficult times. When challenges arise, it’s even more important to recognize your team, especially for their reliability and resilience. Acknowledging the reality of the situation gives your team the chance to share their concerns, which <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/building-trust-workplace/">builds mutual trust</a> and lets employees know that their efforts to help the company during tough times are noticed and appreciated.</p>
<h2>How to make recognition easy and meaningful</h2>
<p>No matter what behavior your company chooses to prioritize for recognition, there are best practices that you can follow to ensure success. The RISE paradigm, which outlines four essential elements that should be included in the design of your recognition program, is a great place to start:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular.</strong> Recognition should occur frequently and be part of every employee’s daily work habits.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate.</strong> Recognize behaviors in the moment and your team will be eager to repeat them.</li>
<li><strong>Specific.</strong> Avoid generic, vague gestures. Instead, explicitly connect recognition to specific behaviors you’d like to see more of.</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging.</strong> Recognition from managers and other leaders isn’t enough. A culture of recognition requires all team members to start showing appreciation. </li>
</ul>
<p>These best practices apply to both <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/social-recognition-what-why-and-how/">social recognition</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-rewards-ideas/">rewards</a>. If you’d like to make it easy for all team members to get involved with the latter, adopt a points-based system that lets your team earn and redeem points for rewards that they actually want. Employees receive an allowance of points they can provide to other team members, and they love seeing their own points balance rise as they receive meaningful recognition.</p>

Culture sets the tone for everything your team does, directly affecting employee engagement and productivity. As a result, the quality of your company culture impacts your bottom line — for better or worse.</p>
<p>Company culture is defined as a set of <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/organizational-culture-definition/">values, expectations, and practices</a> that guide your team each day. You can observe culture through the actions of managers and employees, but sometimes it’s difficult to describe or quantify. It’s not just a mission statement or <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/company-core-value-examples/">statement of values</a>, though these can help show what you want your culture to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-culture-of-belonging/">Create a culture where all employees feel welcome.</a></p>
<p>You need the right words to describe where your company culture is now and where you want it to go. For current team members, defining your culture fosters a sense of unity and ensures everyone is on the same page. And describing your culture in clear, powerful language helps attract more talented employees who align well with your organization.</p>
<p>Here are 17 words that describe great company cultures, along with a few terms that apply to failing cultures.</p>
<h3>1. Rewarding</h3>
<p>A rewarding workplace starts with building a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/takes-recognition-culture-spark-engagement/">culture of recognition</a>. That means recognizing employees for all their contributions to the team, both big and small. When employees feel truly valued, they’re more engaged and productive. For best results, adopt an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-software/">employee recognition solution</a> that enables frequent, personalized social and monetary recognition — the latter in the form of a points-based reward system. This lets employees choose rewards they actually want and easily award points to other team members.</p>
<h3>2. Engaging</h3>
<p>Employee engagement is directly linked to the productivity of your team. But it can be tricky to measure just how engaged employees really are. That’s where <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">employee engagement platforms</a> come in — they <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">enable employee voice</a> by giving you direct, easy-to-access methods to gather, analyze, and act on employee feedback. Using tools like <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">pulse surveys</a> and always-on, AI-powered <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/hr-chatbots/">HR chatbots</a>, these platforms make employees feel heard and give your organization access to the insights it needs to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-action-plans/">act on institutional problems</a> before they impact its bottom line.</p>
<h3>3. Challenging</h3>
<p>Going to work every day becomes a chore if your organization doesn’t provide opportunities for growth. Employees crave a challenge — one that’s stimulating, exciting, and gets them out of bed in the morning. It’s important for managers to foster a work environment where employees not only feel <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-empowerment/">empowered to take on new challenges</a>, but have the resources they need to succeed.</p>
<h3>4. Collaborative</h3>
<p>Every job is more enjoyable when you have colleagues that share in your successes and help with setbacks. Collaboration builds morale and gives your employees a sense of identity within the organization. It helps build a stronger team that can <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/fostering-workforce-resilience-and-connection-during-covid-19-apac/">weather both the good times and bad</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Fun</h3>
<p>Not every moment at work needs to be a blast, but it’s important to take time to have fun with your team. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/10-fun-games-for-team-building/">Building camaraderie through playing games</a> or organizing an outing gives employees a chance to be themselves and get to know each other better. Give your team members a chance to let their hair down and be themselves, and they’ll respond with renewed motivation.</p>
<h3>6. Connected</h3>
<p>With remote work rapidly becoming the new normal, it’s more important than ever to actively <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/the-evolution-of-connection-and-need-for-belonging/">foster connection and belonging at your organization</a>. Employees with a strong sense of belonging are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-culture-of-belonging/">twice as likely</a> to say they&#8217;d recommend their organization to others and that they&#8217;re enthusiastic about their job. Aligning company and employee values, ensuring all employees feel accepted and welcomed, and regularly practicing recognition are just a few of the ways to support belonging at work. It’s also important to have regular, scheduled check-ins with your team and keep tabs on how everyone’s doing — without micromanaging.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/cultivate-an-award-winning-culture-v2/">Discover how a culture of belonging can elevate the employee experience.</a></p>
<h3>7. Transparent</h3>
<p>If you want your team to trust and respect you, transparency is a must. That means regularly updating your team on company operations and being honest at all times. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/information-sharing-why-transparency-and-communication-are-crucial-in-a-crisis/">Even during a crisis</a>, leadership must address problems head on to avoid losing the confidence of their staff.</p>
<h3>8. Inclusive</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/diversity-and-inclusion/">Creating a diverse and inclusive culture</a> is vital to your company’s success. Harvard Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/how-and-where-diversity-drives-financial-performance">found that the most diverse enterprises</a> enjoy 9% higher earnings before taxes and income (EBIT) margins. And McKinsey discovered that organizations that fall in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters">35% more likely</a> to have financial returns above the median for their industry. Creating an inclusive culture means more than just having a diverse workforce, of course. Ensure that everyone on your team, regardless of background, feels valued, respected, and involved.</p>
<h3>9. Welcoming</h3>
<p>The first days, weeks, and months at a new job set the tone for everything that comes after. A <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/successful-onboarding/">welcoming onboarding process</a> can mean the difference between a successful, long career at your organization and a dissatisfied employee who leaves for a competitor in short order. When new employees emerge from onboarding feeling like part of a team, knowing what they have to do and how to do it, they’ll continually strengthen your organizational culture.</p>
<h3>10. Innovative</h3>
<p>The world is always changing, and sooner or later your company will need to innovate to stay competitive and relevant. Young, talented employees are particularly drawn to companies that are willing to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/talking-about-my-generation-engaging-millennials-workplace/">think outside the box</a> and try new strategies to keep them engaged and happy at work. Leadership should serve as examples by showing and rewarding creativity to set the tone for a culture of innovation.</p>
<h3>11. Flexible</h3>
<p>Flexibility at work includes everything from offering employees a variety of scheduling options to allowing team members to work remotely when it makes sense. Employees appreciate the benefits to work-life balance and their daily work experience that flexibility brings. A true culture of flexibility goes beyond this, however, and encompasses an agile, adaptable approach to work where employees aren’t afraid to adjust processes to improve a project or reach a goal.</p>
<h3>12. Positive</h3>
<p>Especially when situations feel dire, it’s important to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/6-ways-leadership-can-build-a-positive-culture/">set a positive tone</a> to keep employee morale up. Positivity gives people hope and a reason to keep going, even on bad days. A positive culture goes hand-in-hand with a transparent, healthy, and fun workplace.</p>
<h3>13. Motivating</h3>
<p>Want to see your team really grow? A company culture that <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/how-to-motivate-employees/">motivates employees</a> to do their best work and take on new challenges can take your team’s productivity to new heights. This starts with showing appreciation to employees for their hard work by developing an organization-wide employee recognition program.</p>
<h3>14. Trusting</h3>
<p>Trust is the cornerstone of a great company culture. When employees trust managers, they feel secure and confident in their work. They believe in organizational goals because they trust the people who set them, so they’ll go above and beyond in pursuit of these milestones. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/building-trust-workplace/">Establishing mutual trust among the whole team</a> is a must for aligning employees with your organizational culture, a driver of sustained business success.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/culture-alignment-techniques-that-drive-business-performance/">Start practicing cultural alignment techniques that drive business performance.</a></p>
<h3>15. Inspiring</h3>
<p>Employees who feel inspired do work that really shines. But how do you foster a company culture that leads to everyday inspiration? Start by defining your <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/company-core-value-examples/">company values</a> — having a strong sense of who you are and what you want to accomplish helps set meaningful goals all team members buy into.</p>
<h3>16. Empathetic</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/emotions-in-the-workplace/">Emotions can get messy</a>, but ignoring them will only cause problems to fester. Instead, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/leaders-need-conversationalists-not-communicators/">listen to your employees when they speak</a> and show that you empathize with the issues they raise. Foster an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/psychological-safety-at-work/">environment of psychological safety</a> where employees feel comfortable expressing themselves honestly — whether in person or through an anonymous feedback channel. Then show team members that your organization truly understands their concerns by acting on their feedback.</p>
<h3>17. Healthy</h3>
<p>A healthy work culture is one that prioritizes employees’ physical and emotional wellness. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-wellness-programs/">Establishing employee wellness programs</a> helps your team <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/burnout-job/">avoid burnout</a> and form healthy habits that will benefit them on and off the job. Team members take notice when their employer shows it’s invested in them as people, not just as employees.</p>
<h2>4 words you don’t want to hear</h2>
<p>Of course, not every word used to describe company culture is positive. These are a few that you don’t want to hear bandied about at your company.</p>
<h3>1. Stressful</h3>
<p>Chronic stress in the workplace eventually leads to burnout. Be sure to offer employees ample time to take breaks and recuperate from stressful tasks, and listen to their needs before it’s too late.</p>
<h3>2. Toxic</h3>
<p>High turnover rates, low employee morale, poor communication, and a fear of speaking up are all signs of a toxic workplace. If this sounds like your company culture, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/5-signs-of-a-toxic-workplace-and-how-to-fix-it/">start finding solutions</a> to address these issues immediately.</p>
<h3>3. Siloed</h3>
<p>Teamwork is important, but <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/diversity-and-inclusion/">silos can hinder collaboration</a> between employees. Try breaking down barriers by improving communication and setting goals that everyone can get behind.</p>
<h3>4. Micromanaged</h3>
<p>While keeping tabs on your team is important, no employee likes feeling that their boss is breathing down their neck. Micromanaging implies a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/building-trust-workplace/">lack of trust</a> in your employees and is detrimental to confidence and productivity. Managers should <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/managers-as-coaches/">approach their role as a coach</a>, placing trust in their team, cheering them on, and providing support as needed.</p>
<h2>Earn rave reviews for your company culture</h2>
<p>Employee engagement is at the heart of all great company cultures. Engagement starts with listening to your employees and giving them a real voice in the workplace. Rewards and recognition also play a key role in keeping employees engaged for years to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/listen/">Achievers Listen</a> is an easy-to-use employee engagement platform backed by science. Its mobile capabilities let everyone on your team provide anonymous feedback where and when they prefer. Robust reporting and analytics features guide your managers from insight to action so employees see the impact of their feedback before they get discouraged.</p>
<p>And it even integrates with <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/">Achievers Recognize</a>, an award-winning, mobile-friendly recognition platform. Achievers Recognize makes recognition a part of each employee’s daily experience thanks to engaging social recognition features and a points-based reward system supported by Achievers’ exceptional rewards marketplace.</p>

Nurturing respect and kindness in the workplace with an employee experience centered around inclusion and belonging is the way forward for organizations looking to have a positive impact on both workplace culture and business outcomes.</p>
<p>CEOs and HR leaders today are at the forefront of this shift. By leveraging their employee voice and employee resource groups alongside a holistic recognition strategy, they are poised to pivot their workplace cultures from the inside out by activating an employee-powered culture. All they need are the right tools and a clear path forward.</p>
<h2>Solving for the employee experience with an integrated ecosystem</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/">Achievers Employee Experience Platform<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> provides organizations with the insights and tools they need to solve their employee experience puzzle. A connected ecosystem of products, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/integrations/">integrations</a>, and partnerships, the platform powers relevant and agile employee experience strategy backed by workforce science to increase employee belonging and activate culture through daily employee and leader participation. Watch our sneak peek <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5E4H01gugo">video</a> to get a sense of what it can do.</p>
<h2>On the cusp of change</h2>
<p>A ripple effect of the pandemic, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/">employee turnover</a> is accelerating, with <strong>51% of employees</strong> saying that they intend to job hunt this year.</p>
<p>While the world paused at the pandemic’s onset and a shift in the way we work took place, employees found themselves re-evaluating their work lives, examining their employee experience, and considered what mattered most to them. For most individuals, the decision to stay or go wasn’t only about salary and benefits. Work-life balance, recognition, and feeling a sense of purpose and belonging are top considerations and areas that employers must address to retain talent.</p>
<p>This era of reflection has given rise to an increasingly important trend — one that organizations should pay close attention to. According to the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-culture-of-belonging-at-work/">2021 Culture Report</a>, employees today want — even need — a work environment that provides them with a sense of connection, belonging, and security. It’s about feeling at home in one’s place without reservation.</p>
<h2>An employee experience backed by research</h2>
<p>Research conducted by the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/">Achievers Workforce Institute</a> continues to correlate a sense of belonging with better outcomes, namely that employees with a strong sense of belonging are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-culture-of-belonging/">twice as likely</a> to be productive, committed, enthusiastic, and resilient. And yet, just <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/about/inclusion-diversity/_acnmedia/Thought-Leadership-Assets/PDF-2/Accenture-Getting-To-Equal-2020-Research-Report.pdf">36% of employees</a> say that their leaders create empowering environments where they feel a true sense of belonging.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/">Achievers Employee Experience Platform </a>bridges this disconnect by providing organizations and their employees with the tools they need to make connections, feel valued, and drive performance — all within the flow of work.</p>
<p>As a leader in recognition and rewards, Achievers has taken a 360-degree approach to employee experience, delivering a holistic solution that ensures an even more connected culture backed by workforce data.</p>
<p>“The framework of belonging is an incredible way to guide organizations through the complexities and priorities of building the employee experience to activate an employee-powered culture,” said Dr. Natalie Baumgartner, Achievers Chief Workforce Scientist. “I’m so proud that we have the opportunity to infuse science-backed thought leadership and the Workforce Institute within the very foundation of our products –helping us solve new problems and deliver on the things that matter to employee belonging.”</p>
<h2>The Achievers Employee Experience Platform is comprised of 5 key products:</h2>

Information that tells you what’s a good investment, and what isn’t. The same is true for the decisions you make around your employee experience. Before investing in a program, you want to be sure that it will produce positive results — both for your employees, and for the business. And once you’ve invested, you want to be about to track your progress along the way, be agile, and adapt your approach based on the results you’re seeing.</p>
<h2>Investing in your employee experience</h2>
<p>Most business decisions leverage financial metrics like return on investment (ROI), net present value (NPV), or internal rate of return (IRR) to help determine which initiatives to fund. Every one of these metrics requires estimates of the benefits associated with each initiative — usually cost reductions or revenue/profit improvements.</p>
<p>A relatively new source of benefits has recently emerged as companies invest in improving their employee experience. Let’s take a closer look at the description of these benefits and how they’re quantified.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Organizations with employees who are more engaged see an average of <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/285674/improve-employee-engagement-workplace.aspx#ite-285782">23% higher profitability</a> and 10% higher customer loyalty.</strong></p>
<p>Employee recognition is no longer a nice-to-have. It’s a must for organizations who value the well-being and productivity of their employees and understand the direct correlation between recognition, engagement, performance, and business outcomes. Recognition is the first (and often, the missing) ingredient to an organization’s success. It’s what differentiates leading organizations and drives innovation.</p>
<p>By focusing on strategic recognition and engagement through the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/">Achievers Employee Experience Platform<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>, CHRISTUS Health — a not-for-profit system made up of more than 600 health centers — saw an immediate 2.9% lower turnover rate, experienced an investment gain of $150,00, and gained a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/case-studies/christus-health-customer-success-story/">return on investment of 250%</a> for every dollar spent.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“<em>Recognition is an integral part of the culture we have built, and we have done the analysis that shows it is an important driver of the strong Associate engagement we have at CHRISTUS.</em>”<br />
&#8211; Ron Croy <br />
Vice President and Chief Talent Officer, CHRISTUS Health</p>
<h2>Setting the stage: Why recognition matters</h2>
<p>Most HR leaders agree that recognition is fundamental in driving engagement — and engagement is critical to an organization’s success, contributing to stats like a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/6-mind-blowing-stats-employee-engagement/">25-59% decrease</a> in turnover and 41% lower absenteeism.</p>
<p>Traditionally, measuring something as elusive as <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-statistics/">engagement</a> proved problematic— and achieving it even more so. But now, engagement is no longer considered intangible. With the right tools, making the link is easy to do and aids in the discussions HR leaders have with their <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/infographics-slideshares/how-to-build-a-case-for-an-employee-recognition-strategy/">c-suite to secure buy-in</a> for a more modernized recognition strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Recognition is a short-term need that has to be satisfied on an <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236951/praise-praising-employees.aspx">ongoing basis</a> — weekly, maybe daily.</strong></p>
<p>Achievers’ customers receive an average of 12.2 recognitions per employee, per year — far greater than the competition. We know that recognition and engagement are positively correlated and that Achievers customers are more likely to be happier, perform better, and contribute to more positive business outcomes.</p>
<h3>Food for thought — recognition fast facts:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every time an organization doubles the number of recognitions received, overall engagement is expected to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-program/#:~:text=Every%20time%20organizations%20double%20the,to%20notice%20their%20good%20work.">increase by 5 points</a></li>
<li>Engaged employees are shown to be 17% more productive</li>
<li>Higher engagement means: less turnover, more productive teams, greater customer satisfaction, and more</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The sweet spot:</strong> “One recognition per employee every 30 days seems to be the tipping point associated with the most predictable improvements to retention and other key metrics, such as customer satisfaction or performance scores,” according to Dr. Natalie Baumgartner, Chief Workforce Scientist at Achievers.</p>
<p>Organizations with 12 recognitions per employee per year (or more) start to see true organizational transformation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://go.achievers.com/rs/iloverewards/images/analytsisinsights-recogition-best-practices.pdf">71%</a> of highly engaged employees work in organizations at which their peers are recognized monthly or more frequently</strong></p>
<h2>Areas of benefit that matter to you</h2>
<p>While many benefits are shared across sectors, each have their primary focus. Here are just a few of the ways that the Achievers platform helps organizations drive an improved employee experience.</p>
<p>Quantifiable benefits include:</p>
<h3>#1 Reduction in employee recruiting and training costs [$]</h3>
<p>Increased employee engagement creates an attractive work environment in which employees thrive and choose to stay.</p>
<p><strong>How to measure: <br />
Expected improvement in turnover rate [%] x Cost to replace an employee [$] x Total number of employees in impacted population [#]*</strong></p>
<p><strong>Case study snapshot:</strong> Meijer, a family-owned superstore based out of the U.S. Midwest, wanted to understand the impact of employee recognition on retention and use these insights to keep their best employees.</p>
<p><strong>The result:</strong> Through their Achievers Employee Experience Platform<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, Meijer was able to identify that recognition had a direct correlation on employee retention. Those who stayed at the company had significantly higher recognition rates than those who left.</p>

<h3>#2 Lowering the costs associated with safety incidents [$]</h3>
<p>In manufacturing and healthcare environments, employee and guest/patient safety is paramount. High levels of employee engagement are shown to result in safer work environments.</p>
<p><strong>How to measure: <br />
Expected improvement in safety incident rate [%] x Average number of annual safety incidents [#] x Cost per safety incident [$]*</strong></p>
<p><strong>Case study snapshot:</strong> Deeply concerned about the health and safety of their patients, CHRISTUS Health implemented a Near Miss/Zero Harm program to encourage the encourage the reporting of incidents that could have caused harm. These reports are used to adjust policies and procedures to ensure greater patient safety.</p>
<p><strong>The result:</strong> Using their Achiever program to execute this important initiative, CHRISTUS Health saw a six-fold rise in near miss reporting — an outstanding improvement considering that often, near miss incidents go unreported, putting patients at risk.</p>

<h3>#3 Lower program costs through program consolidation</h3>
<p>By consolidating all recognition and rewards initiatives into a single platform, organizations increase the visibility of recognition and reward spend, enabling the reallocation of budget from low impact activities to high impact initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>How to measure: <br />
Total current spend across all business units and regions [$] &#8211; Cost of single consolidated program [$]*</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate the total cost of running individual rewards/recognition programs, excluding the cost of the rewards being paid out (e.g., software fees, headcount to run all the separate programs)</li>
<li>Subtract the cost of running a single program (e.g., software fee, headcount to run a single program)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case study snapshot:</strong> Power Design, an electrical contracting company, wanted a program that provided efficiencies around awards reconciliation, saving time, effort, and money.</p>
<p><strong>The result:</strong> By streamlining their recognition programs and housing them all in one place through the Achievers platform, Power Design is afforded more time to learn from each program, identify and execute process improvements, and breathe new life into them with fresh ideas and approaches.</p>

<h3>#4 Increased margin or cost savings through improved productivity</h3>
<p>Highly engaged employees are measurably more productive than less engaged employees. And that productivity, if driving customer satisfaction improvements, manifests itself as increased margin due to higher revenues, or, if driving increased employee efficiencies, results in lower employee costs.</p>
<p><strong>How to measure: </strong><br />
<strong>Expected productivity increase per highly engaged employee [%] x Increase in % of highly engaged employees [%] x Revenue per employee [$] x Margin [%]*</strong></p>
<p><strong>Case study snapshot:</strong> Genesis Hospitality, a collection of hotel chains, aimed to increase productivity and sales through a focus on employee recognition and engagement.</p>
<p><strong>The result:</strong> Suite upsells increased by 62%. In addition, Genesis was named one of Achievers 50 Most Engaged Workplaces and became one of Canada’s Best Managed Companies two years in a row.</p>

<h3>#5 Reduction in customer attrition [$]</h3>
<p>Acquiring new customers is costly. Achievers helps organizations retain customers and maintain a more stable revenue stream through improved employee engagement that drives customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>How to measure: <br />
Improvement in number of customers retained x Average revenue per customer</strong><br />
<strong>Expected reduction in customer attrition [%] x Cost of acquiring a new customer [$]*</strong></p>
<p><strong>Case study snapshot:</strong> A national retailer known for innovation in food and retail practices sought to impact their customer satisfaction by leveraging the connection between employee engagement and customer loyalty. Utilizing the Achievers Employee Engagement Platform<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, the organization drove business success through recognizing employee contributions, aligning them to business objectives and corporate values, and engaging them every day.</p>
<p><strong>The result:</strong> Within the first six months, the retailer experienced a 112% increase in customer satisfaction scores across its stores. A remarkable 70% of the stores achieved a 90% customer satisfaction rating — up from just 33% of stores at the early stages of the program.</p>

It can’t be faked — empty smiles and insincere platitudes don’t translate to team wins and exceptional results. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/">only 1 in 5 employees</a> say they are very engaged and are planning to stay with their company for the long haul.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into all the reasons engagement is a critical part of the employee experience and how your organization can start boosting employee engagement.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/">Discover the state of employee engagement in 2021.</a></p>
<h2>Importance and benefits of engagement</h2>
<p>Employee engagement has many benefits, from more satisfied customers to increased revenue.</p>
<h3>1. Customer satisfaction</h3>
<p>Customers can tell the difference between an engaged workforce and one that’s just putting in time. Research shows that employee engagement is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2014/01/07/employee-engagement-the-wonder-drug-for-customer-satisfaction/?sh=2b22bad6d46b">strongly associated with increased customer satisfaction</a>. Whether it’s a customer service representative that goes above and beyond to solve a frustrating issue, a sales professional who anticipates the client’s every need, or just a vendor’s eager attitude every time you call them, engaged employees mean more satisfied customers.</p>
<h3>2. Workplace safety</h3>
<p>One of the most important benefits of employee engagement is its impact on safety. Gallup found that organizations that rank in the top quarter for engagement had <a href="https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/191831/engaged-workplaces-safer-employees.aspx">70% fewer safety incidents</a> than those in the bottom quarter. Engaged employees will always pay attention to the things, both little and big, that can make a difference between a smooth work day and a job-related accident. And they’ll ensure others do the same.</p>
<h3>3. Employee performance</h3>
<p>Engaged employees perform better — no matter what they put their minds to. Research reveals that organizations with engaged employees <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/04/17/reversing-low-employee-engagement-in-manufacturing/?sh=8962c5628f0f">outperform their counterparts by 202%</a>. When your team is motivated, not only do they give their all to every task, but they proactively seek out the information and resources they need to succeed. When they don’t, they’ll do what they need to do and check out, whether the result was successful or not.</p>
<h3>4. Employee morale</h3>
<p>If you’re motivated to excel at your job, you’re more likely to enjoy it. After all, spending hours each day doing something you don’t believe in is incredibly demoralizing. But performing tasks you find meaningful can lead to greater satisfaction both at work and at home. Work to keep employees engaged and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/boost-employee-morale/">higher morale</a> is likely to result.</p>
<h3>5. Employee retention</h3>
<p>Retaining the best talent is never easy, even when the job market is tight. But boosting employee engagement can help. Engaged employees are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/">significantly less likely to job hunt</a>. When you find your work interesting and motivating, the grass on the other side doesn’t look quite as green.</p>
<h3>6. Profitability</h3>
<p>The many wins of engaged employees show up in your bottom line: <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx">highly engaged business units are 21% more profitable</a>. An engaged workforce brings in new customers, keeps existing ones happy, and inspires their teammates to new heights. And the costs of a disengaged workforce are just as significant: <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-true-cost-of-employee-disengagement/">disengagement costs the U.S. economy up to $550 billion per year</a>.</p>
<h3>7. Employee wellness</h3>
<p>Wellness includes everything that leads to a healthy, well-balanced workforce. Practices like mindfulness, self-awareness, and emotional intelligence are key to mental health, while encouraging fitness and other healthy habits improve physical wellbeing. The draining effect of disengagement takes a mental toll, so keeping employees motivated and committed is an important part of supporting emotional health.</p>
<p><em>“Long-term stress can cause anger, irritability, headaches and sadness, as well as chronic susceptibility to viruses and infections. If your workplace fosters tension, it’s time to gather employee feedback and ask your team how the workflow needs to change.”</em> &#8211; <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/unhappy-employees-unhappy-customers-how-to-break-the-lose-lose-cycle/">Vanessa Brangwyn, Chief Customer Officer, Achievers</a></p>
<h2>Building employee engagement</h2>
<p>What’s the secret to engaged employees? Start by focusing on these two drivers of engagement and you’ll be well on your way.</p>
<h3>Give employees a voice</h3>
<p>Employees want to be heard. If an organization isn’t willing to demonstrate its investment in their success by listening to their concerns and acting on them, why should they invest their hard work in the company? And if you don’t know why employees are disengaged, how can you ever change how they feel?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/empowerment-and-trust-the-keys-to-employee-engagement/">Sixty-four percent of HR leaders</a> agree an always-on feedback tool is a must for any successful engagement listening program, but only 20% have this kind of tool in place. Use an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">employee engagement solution</a> that features a combination of pulse surveys and an always-on feedback channel to keep tabs on employee sentiment and respond to issues in real time. When a survey reveals a problem that’s contributing to disengagement — or one that might impact engagement down the line — your manager can then easily pull the relevant data, present it to their team, and start building a collaborative action plan to address the issue.</p>
<h3>Recognize your workforce</h3>
<p>Employees want to hear that what they do matters and that their work is appreciated. It’s difficult for any team member to stay motivated and continue to put in extraordinary effort when no one seems to notice — or worse, when others are recognized and they’re not. Recognition has a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/">greater impact on employee engagement</a> than any other factor, and organizations with highly-rated cultures of recognition are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">2.5 times more likely to see improved employee engagement</a>.</p>
<p>A successful recognition program has two components: social and monetary recognition. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/social-recognition-what-why-and-how/">Social recognition</a> is anything from a quick thank you to a public call out during an organization-wide meeting, while monetary recognition should be given in the form of a points-based reward system. Employees can then <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-rewards-ideas/">redeem these points for rewards</a> they actually want, creating a far more meaningful experience than receiving a one-size-fits-all t-shirt or mug. Look for an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-software/">employee recognition platform</a> that makes social recognition easy and accumulating reward points exciting.</p>
<h2>Engage your workforce with Achievers</h2>
<p>The right tools make all the difference when attempting to drive engagement. You need to solicit, understand, and act on employee feedback, and recognition should be easy for everyone at your company.</p>

In fact, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/pulse-surveys-employee-engagement/">58% of employees</a> wish their organization conducted employee engagement surveys more often. But before you get started, you need to consider how to best design and manage your organization’s surveys.

<h2>What employee surveys can measure</h2>
<p>Employee surveys can provide insight into all the major drivers of the employee experience. Here are a few of the most important.</p>
<h3>Engagement</h3>
<p>Engaged employees are an organization’s most valuable resource. Organizations that <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/285674/improve-employee-engagement-workplace.aspx">rank in the top 25% for employee engagement</a> see 23% higher profitability, 81% lower absenteeism, and between 18% and 43% less turnover. That’s why you need to keep tabs on engagement levels in real time using employee surveys and act quickly to prevent disengagement from taking root.</p>
<h3>Recognition</h3>
<p>Recognition is one of the most powerful tools available to organizations that want a happier, more successful workforce. The more recently someone is recognized, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/">the higher their engagement is likely to be</a>. Tracking the success of <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/">your organization’s recognition program</a> lets you demonstrate tangible results to leadership and make adjustments to maximize the program’s impact.</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>There are many aspects of <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/organizational-culture-definition/">a great organizational culture</a>, and you need to measure them all. From buying into your company values to trusting in leadership, problems with one part of your culture can affect others in short order. By tracking employee sentiment through frequent surveys, you can rest assured that your team members will stay aligned with the culture you want to build.</p>
<h2>How to deliver employee surveys</h2>
<p>The first decision you have to make when it comes to employee surveys — and the most important — is how you’re going to create and deliver them. You could retain a consulting firm and pay them to conduct and analyze an annual survey. Or you could use an online survey tool to design and implement one yourself.</p>
<p>Neither of these approaches are ideal. An annual engagement survey, whether administered by yourself or a third party — the latter at significant expense — only captures a single moment in time. Recency bias will cause employees to focus on what’s happened a short time ago, not a full view of the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Even if they do provide insights that reflect their experiences over the past year, by the time you’ve analyzed the results, it will be too late to take action on most issues. In a typical cycle, HR will deploy a survey in December, receive results in April, and implement new policies or programs based on the results by perhaps September — a full 10 months after the survey was given. All the while, employees assume nothing is being done. Failing to act promptly on survey results is worse than not asking for employee feedback in the first place.</p>
<p>Creating your own survey, even if delivered more frequently, has problems of its own. It requires immense effort and research to build effective surveys from scratch, and your managers will still lack the guidance they need to take effective action on the results.</p>
<p>Instead of reinventing the wheel or paying for ineffective solutions, look for an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">employee survey platform</a> backed by years of research and experience. Through a combination of <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">pulse surveys</a> — a limited series of questions sent on at least a quarterly basis — and an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">always-on feedback channel</a> for employees to take advantage of, modern survey solutions let you gather feedback in real time, identify and track trends, and quickly take action to nip problems in the bud. And the best platforms are even supported by a team of experts to help you during the transition and afterwards.</p>
<h2>Designing employee surveys</h2>
<p>Here are some guidelines for designing employee surveys that you can put into action yourself or see firsthand by using an employee survey solution.</p>
<h3>Use the Likert scale</h3>
<p>The easier you make answering your question, the more employees will respond, and there’s nothing more straightforward than the Likert scale — a 5-point scale that ranges from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” It’s a simple way to produce data that’s easily measurable and provides more context than binary yes/no or true/false questions. You can even use handy visual representations of each part of the scale so employees can quickly identify which answer best aligns with their feelings.</p>
<h3>Include some open-ended questions</h3>
<p>In addition to binary questions and those using the Likert scale, include some questions that are open-ended and allow employees to express what they feel in their own words. These might touch on areas the employee would like to see addressed in future surveys or ways the team member’s experience could be improved. You can provide the option to leave comments on other questions as well, which often provide useful context when analyzing survey results.</p>
<h3>Ask short questions aligned with your goals</h3>
<p>Regardless of how you format your questions, keep them to the point and aligned with the goals of your survey. If you’re trying to measure the success of your recognition program, ask questions connected to the KPIs you measure success by. If you’ve noticed that burnout is running rampant in your company, stay focused on all the factors that can contribute to it. Lean surveys that get directly to what you want to know at the moment are more digestible for employees and more useful for your company.</p>
<h3>Keep it anonymous</h3>
<p>Anonymous surveys are a must. If your employees know that leaders and HR will be able to connect them to their feedback, they’re not going to tell them things they don’t want to hear. With the security anonymity provides, employees can express themselves honestly and directly address their concerns without fear of retaliation. Practicing anonymity also includes giving employees a private place to complete surveys, so they know no one will be checking on their responses during the process.</p>
<h3>Follow up automatically</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-action-plans/">Taking action on survey results</a> is critical, but even the most rapid response is going to take some time to implement. Your employees need to know that you’ve heard them in the interim. That’s why an always-on feedback channel in the form of an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/hr-chatbots/">intelligent HR chatbot</a> is an integral part of any employee survey solution.</p>
<p>This automated tool can follow up with employees using friendly, simple questions to explore issues uncovered by the survey immediately. Employees then know that the organization is actively engaged with the issues that matter to them, and the company gets additional data to analyze.</p>
<h2>Questions to ask</h2>
<p>Still wondering what a good employee survey actually looks like? Here are some <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-questions/">questions in key categories</a> that reveal useful insights, phrased as statements employees can rank using the Likert scale:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognition.</strong> You’re recognized for your contributions to the company.</li>
<li><strong>Culture.</strong> Our company has a healthy culture.</li>
<li><strong>Morale.</strong> You enjoy coming to work each day.</li>
<li><strong>Values.</strong> You’re inspired by our company’s mission and values.</li>
<li><strong>Career advancement.</strong> There’s a clear path for career growth available at our company.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership.</strong> Your manager is invested in the success of your team.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback.</strong> You feel comfortable providing honest feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Health and wellness.</strong> You have a healthy work-life balance.</li>
<li><strong>Team.</strong> You have a collaborative relationship with fellow team members.</li>
<li><strong>Open-ended.</strong> If you could change one thing about this organization, what would it be, and why?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Responding to employee surveys</h2>
<p>If you don’t act on issues revealed by employee surveys, you’ll have wasted all the time and effort you spent on designing and delivering them. But <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">analyzing survey data and deciding on how to respond</a> is anything but simple. Here’s how you can quickly take concrete steps in the right direction.</p>
<h3>Analyze</h3>
<p>You can’t afford analysis of survey results to take weeks or months. To accelerate the feedback loop, take advantage of an employee survey platform that comes with robust tools for digging into the data and helps you understand key findings at a glance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heat maps</strong> are grids that let you visually identify areas where your organization is doing well — highlights — and areas where it needs to improve — hotspots. You can use heat maps to uncover actionable insights as soon as a survey round opens.</li>
<li><strong>Establishing benchmarks</strong> — whether based on industry-standard performance or against other teams or business units — is a great way to identify areas where certain groups are falling behind. Tracking your progress against benchmarks over time in your platform lets you easily measure progress towards your goals as well.</li>
<li><strong>Dashboards</strong> provide information on all your KPIs in one place, and they allow you to access other analytics tools and generate reports using an intuitive interface. You can even tailor them to suit various managers’ unique needs.</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> are a great source of contextual information, but sifting through them poses a challenge. Look for a solution that lets you sort through them by category and efficiently navigate between them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Above all, ensure that managers play the leading role in reviewing the results of your survey. They’re the ones who can take action on a team level to implement changes. HR professionals should support them, giving them the tools and guidance they need to successfully navigate the survey process.</p>
<h3>Act</h3>
<p>Selecting a one-size-fits-all response from an action library lets your managers check a box and move on, rather than actively engaging with the unique circumstances they face and taking steps to address them. Instead, all managers should share survey results with their team, discuss the insights they’ve gained, and then create a collaborative action plan to tackle any issues identified. Managers should then work with their team and other parties to carry out next steps, preferably in the form of quick, tangible actions — otherwise known as micro-actions — that can be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>The collaborative aspect is critical: every team member has their own needs and wants, so each should be consulted and given the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">chance to voice their thoughts</a> on the best way forward. When you <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-empowerment/">empower employees</a> to take ownership of correcting the problems they see in the workplace, they’ll respond with increased engagement and a willingness to do what it takes to build the organization they want to see.</p>

None of us were prepared for this watershed experience and HR leaders have been on the frontline of this tsunami of change. Today, as the flood waters recede, what fresh treasures will we find left behind?</p>
<p>You have likely seen belonging at work become increasingly a topic of conversation for HR and business leaders. ‘Belonging’ ranked at the top of the Deloitte 2020 Global Human Capital Trends survey, with 79% of organizations considering it important for their success. There is a significant amount of academic research into belonging, showing that employees who feel a sense of belonging at work have higher overall work engagement. More specifically, these employees are more likely to experience greater job satisfaction, better mental health, higher levels of productivity, and lower levels of both.</p>
<p>At the Achievers Workforce Institute, we strive to advance academic knowledge and understanding with our in-depth and robust research reports. To that end, we built on secondary research to develop a belonging model and tested that model with a survey to more than 3,500 employees around the world.</p>
<p>That research forms the foundation of the Achievers Workforce Institute <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-culture-of-belonging">2021 Culture Report on Belonging at Work</a>.</p>
<h2>The business case for belonging at work</h2>
<p>Belonging is a key driver of individual and organizational success. People with a strong sense of belonging are twice as likely to be engaged — and they’re also twice as likely to be productive, resilient, satisfied, and committed.</p>
<p>Our research confirmed our hypothesis that belonging is a key factor to foster inside your organization because when people feel a strong sense of belonging, they are also far more likely to be happy, healthy, and productive employees at work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people with a low sense of belonging are only a quarter as likely to say that they’re engaged and they express much lower levels of commitment, enthusiasm, productivity, and resilience.</p>
<p>We know that there are many employees in the workplace today that are truly struggling and we believe that by building and fostering an experience of belonging we have the opportunity to help them become thriving, productive, happy team members once again.</p>
<h2>Building a culture of belonging</h2>
<p>But it wasn’t enough for us to say “this matters”. We also needed to answer the question “how do we get there?”</p>
<p>That’s where the five pillars of belonging come in. When your employees feel <strong>welcomed, known, included, supported, and connected</strong>, then you can be confident they feel a strong sense of belonging at your organization. Many of the HR tools and programs you already have in place are supporting one or more of these pillars. In fact, these pillars offer a clear framework for assessing HR technology and training by ensuring it aligns with at least one pillar.</p>
<h2>Activating the five pillars of belonging at work</h2>
<p>How can you activate each pillar to ensure your employees feel that strong sense of belonging at work that will enable positive business outcomes?</p>

Handling all these incoming requests can be tricky, even for companies with a substantial number of HR employees on staff. But it’s on HR to regularly ask employees for feedback, highlight employee success stories, and build a culture employees actually feel connected to.</p>
<p>Below, we’ll cover why HR communication matters and outline seven ways to perfect your HR communication strategy.</p>
<h2>The key role HR communication plays in organizational success</h2>
<p>There are many concrete ways HR communication contributes to business success. Here are just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better understanding of roles and responsibilities</strong> &#8211; Employees perform their best when they know what’s expected of them. HR communication ensures that team members understand the terms and conditions of their employment and know what to do to get promoted. Having a clear path to success paved with challenging, interesting work drives commitment and loyalty.
</li>
<li><strong>Improved employee morale and engagement</strong> &#8211; HR communication isn’t a one-way street. In fact, one of the hallmarks of an outstanding HR communication strategy is soliciting feedback from employees. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">Giving employees a voice</a>, listening to their concerns, answering their questions, and acting on feedback lets team members know you care and boosts engagement. Your HR team should concentrate on developing this rapport with employees <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-life-cycle/">throughout their lifecycle</a> at the company. This means finding creative, compelling ways to engage them during recruiting, onboarding, and beyond.
</li>
<li><strong>Fewer conflicts</strong> &#8211; Making sure everyone’s playing by the same rules helps lessen the chances for misunderstandings. Maintaining consistent messaging and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/organizational-culture-definition/">establishing a welcoming culture</a> can reduce the chance for grievances and even lawsuits. If problems arise, take the time to listen to employees and request input from all constituencies to figure out next steps.
</li>
<li><strong>A boost to the bottom line</strong> &#8211; Standardizing HR processes increases efficiency, lowers costs, and breaks down silos. When launching your HR communication strategy, identify priority areas for alignment across the business and measure the impact of your strategy in the coming months or quarters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7 strategies for improving HR communication</h2>
<p>Keeping everyone at your organization on the same page is a tall order. But it can be done, and the rewards are significant. Here are 7 strategies for building great HR communication processes that accomplish just that.</p>
<h3>1. Work to get buy-in from leadership</h3>
<p>Your best ideas won’t go anywhere without the input and support of leadership. Executives set an example for all employees, and other team members respect and emulate them. Getting leadership on board is key to formalizing your communication strategy and ensuring participation.</p>
<p>Start by <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wow-the-c-suite-as-an-hr-professional/">focusing on numbers</a> 一 what the C-suite really cares about. It’s not just about how much amping up your HR communication processes will cost, it’s about the return on investment leadership should expect to see. Frame your proposal in those terms so that they can better quantify potential outcomes.</p>
<p>Take the time to read reports and case studies to find out how to estimate future ROI and measure your ongoing successes. You should also try instituting a pilot and then collecting employee feedback. Present this to leadership as just the beginning of what you’ll be able to achieve with a full blown program, and explain that this is something employees want and are eager to participate in. When you have the data to back you up, leadership will support your plan to improve HR communication over the long haul.</p>
<h3>2. Align your communication strategy with your organization’s goals</h3>
<p>Just like on a crew team, all team members at your organization need to row in the same direction. Aligning HR communication with your business objectives ties everything together in employees’ minds. If your company is trying to reach a certain goal, HR activities and communication should follow suit.</p>
<p>Matching HR communication with your organization’s priorities starts by focusing on <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/company-core-value-examples/">your company’s core values</a>. <a href="https://www.ihire.com/blog/core-values-2020-survey-results">Over 75% of employees</a> consider it “very important” to work for a company with defined core values. Every HR-related email, all-hands announcement, survey, and Slack message should reflect your company’s mission and vision. And HR can double down on this strategy by recognizing employees who live by your company’s values. Doing so <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">reinforces positive behaviors</a> and further intertwines employee values and goals with your company’s.</p>
<h3>3. Obtain and act on employee feedback</h3>
<p>HR should be prescriptive about how to manage effectively, how to measure performance, and how to onboard employees. But team members’ opinions should shape these efforts as well. After all, employees are the ones who have to follow these tenets in their everyday work lives. Most companies feel like they’re doing a good job of listening to their employees by sending an annual engagement survey.</p>
<p>While that’s a start, that certainly shouldn’t be your end goal. HR teams need to frequently solicit and then <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-action-plans/">help managers act on employee feedback</a>. Responding tangibly to employee feedback is one of the most vital drivers of engagement 一 a whopping <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">90% of workers</a> are more likely to stay at an employer that collects and takes action on feedback. But emailing employees every day asking for their thoughts is not the answer. Instead, adopt tools like pulse surveys and intelligent HR chatbots 一 preferably as part of a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">comprehensive employee engagement solution</a> that <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">enables quick action on survey results</a> 一 to set your company apart.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">Pulse surveys</a> — focused, relatively brief, anonymous questionnaires — give you a sense of how team members feel regarding a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-questions/">specific decision or subject</a>. Sending pulse surveys month-to-month or on another recurring schedule shows how people are responding to key initiatives over time. If you’re not seeing the results you expect, you can adjust quickly, before issues have a significant impact on your organization.</p>
<p>Intelligent, always-on feedback channels like <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">AI-powered HR chatbots</a> proactively ask employees questions about their work-life balance, relationship with their manager, and workload. Unlike HR employees, chatbots are available to answer common questions and listen to employees 24 hours a day. They also learn from what employees tell them, analyzing feedback and serving up recommendations or surfacing team-related issues to managers.</p>
<h3>4. Connect employees to enable teamwork</h3>
<p>Teamwork makes the dream work. But collaboration requires genuine connections between your employees. They need to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/building-a-team-of-true-team-players/">feel like their coworkers are accountable and dependable</a>, and that they’ll take the time to listen without making snap judgments. Employees should be comfortable asking for help when they need it, want to show up for others in need, and recognize their peers’ accomplishments.</p>
<p>Consider adding some of these characteristics to your core values and recognize examples of high-performing employees and managers epitomizing this in their everyday work. And make a point to recognize employees during <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-appreciation-day/">Employee Appreciation Day</a>, International Women’s Day, and Bosses Day. You can even make recognition a part of each employee’s daily work experience by <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-program/">creating a recognition program</a> built around mobile-friendly, easy-to-use recognition software.</p>
<p>HR can also support teamwork through mentor or <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/managers-as-coaches/">coaching programs</a>. These can help new employees get acquainted with your company and meet new people, or help employees wanting to move up the ladder or switch into new roles someone to look to for guidance.</p>
<p>Finally, HR should create opportunities to showcase the good things that are happening in each department, like all hands meetings or virtual office hours. Not only does this break down silos, it also helps people do their jobs better, makes them feel like they are in the loop, and encourages cross-collaboration. These tactics are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/nl/resources/webinars/fostering-workforce-resilience-and-connection-during-covid-19-apac/">especially useful for engaging remote employees</a>, as many people working from home experience loneliness and disengagement.</p>
<h3>5. Publicize and support key initiatives</h3>
<p>How will anyone know about the awesome things HR and employees are doing if you don’t publicize them? To gain everyone’s support, you need to advertise key HR initiatives like <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-networks-inclusive-culture/">employee resource groups</a>, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-ideas-activities/">employee engagement activities</a>, and perhaps most importantly, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-program/">your recognition program</a>. People want to know they are being advocated for and championed in their organization, and HR needs to take the lead in showcasing these efforts. Look for a recognition platform that includes tools like a company-wide newsfeed to make highlighting initiatives and employees easy.</p>
<h3>6. Train employees and leadership on best practices</h3>
<p>Training staff and leadership on how to communicate should be a major HR priority. Teach your managers how to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/leaders-need-conversationalists-not-communicators/">get the most out of each conversation with employees</a>, rather than hurrying to get them over with. Employees want to hear from their bosses and anticipate detailed feedback. Vague, flippant responses show a lack of respect and are difficult to interpret and act upon.</p>
<p>HR should urge managers and leaders to listen to their direct reports. Executives aren’t on the ground and don’t have context for issues that arise. Instead of jumping in to try to resolve something, leaders should wait until they have a full grasp on the situation and understand the root cause of the problem at hand.</p>
<p>Leaders also must <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/information-sharing-why-transparency-and-communication-are-crucial-in-a-crisis/">remember to be transparent</a>. This is easier said than done, especially if a company is in dire straits. But if the pandemic taught us anything, it’s that people appreciate openness. Employees can see right through disingenuous communication, which builds resentment and distrust. Instead, share key information with your team and demonstrate accountability.</p>
<h3>7. Prioritize communication during the onboarding process</h3>
<p>When you’re starting a new job, it’s easy to feel like a fish out of water. You don’t know anyone, you’re not sure what your responsibilities are, and it’s not always clear where to find information. The onboarding process is where HR communication can really shine. Excellent HR communication makes a great impression on new employees and sets them off on the right foot.</p>
<p>Beyond covering job duties, explain cultural norms, talk about the typical feedback cycle, and introduce employees to other team members in employee resource groups. Sign newcomers up for any coaching or buddy systems you might have in place as well. Every few days, check in with employees to see how they’re doing 一 <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/onboarding-remote-employees/">particularly if they’re onboarding remotely</a>.</p>
<p>Ensure managers are invested in the onboarding process as well. Encourage them to schedule frequent, recurring one-on-ones with new direct reports, and have them assign new hires a project to complete in the first few weeks. This gives the employee something to work towards and makes them feel like a valued member of the team.</p>
<p>Lastly, don’t forget about <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/four-people-forgot-onboarding-program/">onboarding employees who aren’t quite new hires</a>. Contractors who’ve graduated to full-time staff positions, new parents returning from maternity or paternity leave, team members coming back from medical leave, and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/why-boomerang-employees-are-a-good-thing/">boomerang employees</a> can feel neglected and out of place. Make them feel comfortable by building onboarding processes that address their unique needs.</p>
<h2>Enable effective HR communication with technology</h2>
<p>To implement first-class HR communication, it needs to be a part of each stage of the employee lifecycle. But it’s tough for HR to maintain consistent lines of communication, recognize team members who are living your company culture, and hear from every employee about what could be better, all while keeping up with their other daily responsibilities.</p>
<p>HR platforms like <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/listen/">Achievers Listen</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/">Achievers Recognize</a> can help. Achievers Listen is an end-to-end employee engagement solution, capturing employee voice at every step of a team member’s journey with your company.

While it has its benefits, working remotely removes the opportunity to bump into each other in the hallway, have an impromptu chat, or even take colleagues out to lunch. Without frequent two-way conversations, it’s tough for managers to establish and maintain relationships with their employees, make meaningful changes, and encourage better performance.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the power of AI can help keep all employees connected and engaged through intelligent HR chatbots that <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">give employees a way to voice their concerns</a> at any time. When employees can express themselves anonymously whenever they need to, they’ll feel more engaged — and you’ll have access to real time feedback you can use to address critical issues at your organization.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">Discover how AI and HR chatbots power the new engagement conversation.</a></p>
<p>Take a look at how HR chatbots can change your workplace and the best ways to start using them.</p>
<h2>Why HR chatbots?</h2>
<p>An HR chatbot harnesses the power of AI to converse with employees or prospective employees, driving the digital employee experience. They use natural language processing to converse with users via websites, apps, phones, and other messaging applications.</p>
<p>Chatbots work because so many people are already familiar with digital communication. Business Insider research indicates that the top four messaging apps have <a href="https://medium.com/hijiffy/10-graphs-that-show-the-immense-power-of-messaging-apps-4a41385b24d6">more monthly active users than the top four social networking apps</a>, and over half of users between the ages of 18 and 55 in the U.S. have interacted with chatbots.</p>
<p>HR chatbots provide an always-on channel for employees to communicate with your organization. This empowers employees to provide valuable feedback, anonymously, at any time. HR chatbots make giving feedback an ongoing conversation, providing managers with the data they need to institute meaningful changes quickly.</p>
<h2>How to improve the employee experience with HR chatbots</h2>
<p>HR chatbots can dramatically improve employee performance and the bottom line — when used effectively. Here are two of the most impactful ways to use HR chatbots.</p>
<h3>Collect and understand employee feedback</h3>
<p>HR chatbots are a great way to proactively request feedback, using AI to scale human-to-human connection. Many enterprises still rely on the dreaded annual survey to obtain feedback from their employees. These surveys take a significant amount of time to analyze, so the results are no longer actionable by the time the process is complete.</p>
<p>Annual surveys must be replaced with realtime reactions and suggestions. A 24/7 chatbot offers employees opportunities to share their thoughts whenever it’s convenient for them. The best chatbots make soliciting feedback casual and intuitive, asking employees to communicate how they are feeling with a simple emoji. And whatever information employees share with chatbots is easily anonymized, so employees can share how they truly feel.</p>
<p>On the back end, machine learning capabilities turn regular feedback into personalized suggestions for each employee. Chatbots can measure employee engagement in terms of their role, personal development, perception of leadership and company strategy, and even their work-life balance. Managers can use chatbot guidance to develop plans of action that direct reports will be receptive to. Bots can also surface negative team dynamics that supervisors may not be aware of, and leaders can use chatbot data to inform how they confront these problems, whether that be through face-to-face discussions or organizing activities to increase collaboration and team bonding.</p>
<p>The best part is that HR chatbots can reveal whether or not the changes managers make actually improve employee engagement. When things aren’t working, managers can quickly adapt their approach instead of waiting for a whole year to go by.</p>
<h3>Stay connected with remote employees</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that HR professionals are struggling to engage employees who are now working from home. Remote employees can feel lonely and detached from the goings-on at your company, but HR chatbots help bridge the gap. Chatbots promote interaction by letting all employees connect with HR at any time and by asking thoughtful questions about how employees are feeling. You can make HR chatbots available on any channel, 24/7, so remote employees are never left isolated. Consider customizing your chatbot to pop up on your intranet or on messaging apps that employees use, like Slack or Teams, to further increase engagement.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/artificial-intelligence-in-the-workplace-making-work-more-human-not-less/">Learn how AI is changing the workplace in fundamental ways.</a></p>
<h3>Overcoming HR chatbot challenges</h3>
<p>Of course, implementing an HR chatbot isn’t as simple as snapping your fingers. Confidentiality is just one of many issues that are sure to be on employees’ minds when they first use the chatbot. The good news is that HR teams know a thing or two about privacy. In fact, they deal with sensitive data all the time. Opt for a chatbot with built-in encryption and permissions systems to authorize specific individuals to view and act on confidential information.</p>
<p>HR teams might be worried that most bots can only help them so much. When a bot can’t assist an employee, it immediately routes the inquiry to a human, only creating more work for HR. That’s why you should look for an AI-based chatbot that learns over time. They’re programmed to learn employee preferences and patterns over time to provide data-driven recommendations. These suggestions empower both managers and employees alike.</p>
<p>Accessibility can be another issue with HR bots. If chatbots are only available during certain hours, employees will be less likely to respond to them. The best chatbots are accessible anytime, anywhere and are easy for anyone to use.</p>
<h3>Open a 24/7 feedback channel with an HR chatbot</h3>
<p>HR chatbots are a game-changer in the world of engagement. They serve as a much-needed outlet for employees and serve up additional insights to managers looking to understand what makes each member of their team tick.</p>
<p>The key to achieving these results is choosing the right engagement software. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/listen/">Achievers Listen</a> is an end-to-end engagement platform that comes with a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">premier HR chatbot named Allie</a>. Allie is designed with science in mind, delivering the same atmosphere employees might expect from a mentoring session. Allie learns from the responses she gets, asking more specific questions and giving more pointed feedback to employees’ managers over time. With state-of-the-art encryption methods, any information employees share with Allie is safe.</p>
<p>“Allie guides employees through more in-depth questions regarding their engagement levels— resulting in richer feedback. The responses of our employees will allow ECI to take more timely action on areas negatively impacting our employee engagement. Additionally, it will allow us to reinforce those actions that strengthen the engagement of our employees.” &#8211; <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">Andrew Pryor</a>, SVP of HR, ECI Software Solutions</p>

<p>Cultural change is never easy, but you can start making tangible steps in the right direction today. Read on to discover how your organization can start changing its culture for the better.</p>
<h2>What changing organizational culture means</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/organizational-culture-definition/">What is organizational culture?</a> It might be easier to say what it’s not. It encompasses your company’s values, goals, and daily practices. It’s what makes your organization unique. A great culture motivates your whole team to excel — and it keeps them smiling along the way.</p>
<p>When does your culture need to change? The short answer is that there’s always room for improvement. The best companies never rest on their laurels. They’re constantly looking for ways to better align their culture with their workforce and adapt to meet new challenges.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/5-signs-of-a-toxic-workplace-and-how-to-fix-it/">cultural warning signs</a> that indicate the need for immediate change that you should look out for. Some are obvious, like high turnover rates and negative feedback from current and former employees. Signals like a lack of participation in meetings (noticed any long, awkward silences recently?) or changes in body language and verbal communication styles are more subtle but no less troubling.</p>
<p>Organizational culture <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-culture-report/">affects everything from your bottom line to engagement</a>, so ignoring these signs — or failing to reexamine your culture regularly — is a dangerous gamble. A new culture won’t appear overnight, but done right, building one is more than possible. Follow these best practices and you’ll soon be changing your organizational culture for the better.</p>
<h2>1. Define your cultural vision</h2>
<p>Without a clear vision, your attempts at cultural change will be haphazard and ineffective. Defining the culture you want to see is a two-part process. First, determine what values and behaviors would make your culture exceptional. Then take a look at the factors that currently define your organizational culture with the goal of identifying those that you should prioritize changing to realize your vision.</p>
<p>An organization’s culture is more than its <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/company-core-value-examples/">core values</a>, but those values form the foundation for the actions that shape culture on a day-to-day basis. Your values should be unique to your organization, connected to your mission, and easy to understand and communicate. Think about what your culture should represent. Appreciation, resilience, teamwork, integrity, trust — these are more than just words. They’re concepts everyone can connect to, which makes them the building blocks of a successful organization.</p>
<p>While examining your company values, think about what behaviors would reflect them and make a difference at your organization. For instance, your organization might demonstrate trust by <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-empowerment/">empowering employees</a> through assigning new responsibilities, supporting professional development, and giving them a real voice in your organization. Or it might build a culture of appreciation by encouraging everyone to provide genuine, frequent social and monetary recognition. Your culture also comes out in regular business interactions, like a customer service representative responding to a customer complaint or a manager providing feedback to an employee.</p>
<p>After you’ve envisioned where you want to go, it’s time to take an honest look at your current culture and identify how it’s falling short. It might be a failure to act on employee feedback and concerns. Or it might be a workforce that doesn’t have the tools or direction they need to effectively collaborate. Whichever aspects of your culture don’t meet your ideal, those are the ones you need to focus on improving.</p>
<h2>2. Make discrete changes</h2>
<p>Cultural change will always be a gradual process, so making drastic changes with no lead time is a recipe for disaster. While it may be tempting to “fix the problem” immediately by taking a broad, heavy-handed approach, lasting cultural change doesn’t work that way. Not only will this confuse and alienate your workforce, it will likely create new cultural weakpoints in the process — or even exacerbate existing issues rather than solving them. For example, firing your entire management team to address poor practices is likely to be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Unless your organization suffers from truly extreme cultural issues that require equally extreme solutions, your organization is best served by making discrete changes whose impact it can measure. It could be implementing a new PTO policy to combat burnout, providing training to managers to improve communication with direct reports, or adopting a recognition platform that makes it easy for all team members to show appreciation. These focused initiatives won’t unnecessarily disrupt your workplace, and you can easily track their effects and make adjustments as needed.</p>
<h2>3. Adapt based on metrics and employee feedback</h2>
<p>So, how can you tell if your culture is moving in the right direction? Start with a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/listen/">voice of the employee solution</a> that makes it easy to collect employee feedback and track key performance indicators (KPIs) like employee engagement scores and supervisor ratings. It should include pulse surveys — short, anonymous questionnaires centered on only a few aspects of the employee experience — that can be tailored to solicit information on whatever changes you’re making. Combined with an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">always-on feedback channel</a> that employees can use to let you know what’s on their mind at any time, you can find out what employees think of your current culture and your efforts to change it.</p>
<p>Listening to feedback isn’t enough, though. You need to show employees you hear their concerns and recognize their validity by taking concrete action in response to feedback. This needs to take place at the manager level — while HR should provide tools and direction, it’s up to managers to make changes among their teams. The best platforms help managers move from insight to action by presenting them with relevant highlights and guiding them along the way to a meeting with their team, with the goal of coming up with a collaborative action plan that everyone believes in.</p>
<p>You should also make use of additional HR tools to track additional metrics specific to the cultural initiatives you’re pursuing. This might include a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-software/">recognition platform</a> that reveals how many employees are participating in your recognition program, the level of recognition activity at your organization, and other handy data. With a holistic perspective on your culture, you can determine what changes should be made and how they’re progressing.</p>
<h2>4. Change from the top down and bottom up</h2>
<p>Cultural change requires the investment of everyone at your organization, from staff to your CEO. Executives and other key stakeholders must recognize the need for cultural change at your organization and buy into your plan to accomplish that change. Leaders also have a special responsibility to act as culture champions, serving as examples of where you want your culture to go. All team members should support cultural change informally in their day-to-day activities and by participating in formal initiatives at your organization. And HR should handle the training and organization-wide communication needed to support cultural change.</p>
<h2>Empower your workforce with the right tools</h2>
<p>Cultural change doesn’t have to be hard. With solutions that give your employees a voice and get everyone involved in recognition, you can start engaging your employees and changing your culture all at the same time. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/listen/">Achievers Listen</a> lets you quickly collect employee feedback and provides you with the key insights you need to act on it, while <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/">Achievers Recognize</a> makes social recognition engaging and monetary recognition easy with a points-based reward system.</p>

You’re not alone.</p>
<p>Failing to collect feedback takes an enormous toll on employees. So much so that disengaged employees cost U.S. companies up to <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/study-disengaged-employees-can-cost-companies-up-to-550b-a-year/437606/">$550 billion a year</a>. Luckily, many companies are beginning to adopt a culture of feedback, and it’s working 一 giving employees a voice through employee surveys makes them <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/inclusive-leadership-practices/understand-the-business-impact-of-inclusive-leadership#:~:text=Employees%20who%20feel%20their%20voice,to%20perform%20their%20best%20work">4.6 times more likely to feel empowered to perform their best work</a>. What’s more, highly engaged teams show <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx">21% greater profitability</a>, 41% reduction in absenteeism, and 59% less turnover.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/">Discover how to boost employee engagement in this free report from Achievers.</a></em></strong></p>
<p>But what many organizations don’t realize is that collecting feedback is just one piece of the feedback puzzle. When organizations don’t act on feedback they solicit, it can feel like employees are just screaming into a void. In fact, Gallup found that doing a survey with no follow-up is <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/241253/ways-botch-employee-surveys.aspx">worse than doing nothing at all</a>. That’s why employee engagement action plans are vital to your organization’s success.</p>
<h2>Understanding employee engagement action plans</h2>
<p>Employee engagement action plans are meant to address feedback received from employees, whether through <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">pulse surveys</a> or an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">AI-powered always-on feedback channel</a>. When employers take the time to construct action plans, they demonstrate to employees that their voice matters, increasing employee engagement, productivity, and retention. In fact, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">90% of workers</a> say they are more likely to stay at an employer that takes and acts on feedback. But the true power of employee engagement action plans relies on the active participation of individual managers. </p>
<p>To develop strategies that actually work, managers must consult their direct reports. Managers have the unique ability to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">involve each team member in creating action plans</a>, asking for context, ideas, and more. Teach your managers how to establish a safe space where employees feel comfortable sharing their true feelings. Instruct leaders to ask follow up questions and recognize employees when they contribute to difficult conversations. Managers should also help employees take ownership of the plan, laying out next steps they feel they can contribute to.</p>
<p>By working together as a team, managers can hold people accountable for their portions of the action plan, and make them feel like they are part of the solution at the same time. As action plans are put into practice, employees will learn that speaking up has a true effect on the business and gives them the confidence to continue providing feedback. Further, this approach fosters trust between them, their teammates, and their manager.</p>
<h2>3 steps to creating an employee engagement action plans</h2>
<p>Start developing effective employee engagement action plans by following these three simple steps.</p>
<h3>1. Analyze the survey results and identify priorities</h3>
<p>Analyzing employee engagement survey results is the first step towards creating a winning action plan. Once you have a sense of where your organization can improve, you can work with managers to solve those problems. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">Look for an employee engagement platform</a> that includes robust reporting functionality on the backend, enabling you to create dashboards and heatmaps.</p>
<p>When analyzing results, pay attention to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/hr-metrics/">engagement scores, response rate, and benchmarks</a>. Look at your employee engagement scores over time to see if there are any trends. Perhaps there are blips correlated to specific company decisions or in response to economic drivers. Dive deeper into those anomalies to see where they might be stemming from. Take note of response rates as well to ensure you’re getting enough accurate data. If you find that your response rate is trailing off, consider rewriting survey questions to be more relevant or cutting down the number of questions to make surveys easier to finish.</p>
<p>Lastly, compare your organization’s metrics to external and internal benchmarks. Do some research to find out how other businesses in your industry might be doing in terms of engagement or response rate and examine changes to your internal numbers month-over-month or year-over-year. A frame of reference can be helpful if you want to show progress or ask for more funding around engagement activities.</p>
<h3>2. Build a collaborative action plan</h3>
<p>Making action planning a collaborative process is the key to executing on them. To begin, have managers reserve time for listening sessions with their teams. In these forums, managers should first review survey results, highlighting things that went well and surfacing areas for improvement. After that, leadership should seek input from their team members. This session should give any team member equal right to voice their opinion on actions they feel should be taken next. </p>
<p>Write down these thoughts on a physical or virtual whiteboard, and eventually your action plan will start to take shape. Customizing your action plan based on these ideas ensures buy-in from employees and shows them that their feedback is taken seriously. Keep in mind that action plans don’t have to be elaborate, multi-step procedures. Taking micro-actions, quick ways to respond to feedback, help make the action plan feel more manageable and can generate positive results fast.</p>
<h3>3. Keep soliciting feedback</h3>
<p>Acting on feedback once or twice a year doesn’t cut it. It&#8217;s important to keep your finger on the pulse of the evolving employee landscape to ensure employees have the resources and support to perform their best. Re-survey employees regularly to make feedback a habit, keep analyzing results to verify that action plans are working, and continually implement additional action plans to address new issues that arise.</p>
<p>Remember to revisit parts of action plans that may need adjustments. If you’re not seeing improvement, employees aren’t seeing any difference either. Make sure managers are sticking to the plans they’ve created with their teams, and help them identify micro-actions so that change is more noticeable and timely. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">Take a deep dive into your employee engagement survey results</a> to ensure that the issues prioritized have the biggest potential to make lasting, favorable impacts.</p>
<h2>Employee engagement action plan best practices</h2>
<p>Besides these three tried and true steps, there are other best practices for creating employee engagement action plans. First, ditch annual surveys. They don’t capture the day-to-day employee experience and are difficult to act on quickly. Instead, try <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">frequent, focused pulse surveys</a> that provide a realtime window into employee engagement, together with <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">AI-powered HR chatbots</a> that interact with employees on a routine basis. These bots use machine learning to detect underlying issues before they even arise and give managers pointers on how to best listen to and engage with their direct reports.</p>
<p>On a similar note, it’s beneficial to adopt a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">comprehensive employee engagement solution</a>. Look for an engagement platform that allows all relevant stakeholders一from HR professionals to managers to executives一to deliver, review, and act on employee engagement surveys.</p>
<p>Beyond technology, focus your initiatives on whatever the most important (or most neglected) drivers of employee engagement are for your team and organization. This could mean low morale, poor leadership, ineffective recognition, lack of professional development opportunities, or something else.</p>
<h2>Build employee engagement with Achievers</h2>
<p>Collaborative action plans aren’t possible without enough feedback to substantiate them and measure their effectiveness. That said, gathering ample feedback in a non-intrusive way can be difficult. You don’t want to overwhelm or annoy employees or they’ll stop taking surveys altogether. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/listen/">Achievers Listen</a> is built to continuously solicit feedback in ways that don’t disrupt an employee’s workday.</p>
<p>Achievers Listen enables the delivery of frequent pulse and lifecycle surveys that are easy for employees to answer. It also includes Allie, a state-of-the-art HR chatbot that invites employees to anonymously share how they feel about work. Through one-click poll questions, the bot can help managers better understand what employees are going through, and it makes taking action on feedback quick and simple. And Achievers Listen’s built-in Action Builder feature takes people leaders from analysis to action by coaching them on how to put together action plans that actually work in the long run.</p>
<p>There’s no better way to start establishing a culture of feedback than by <a href="https://www.achievers.com/demo/">scheduling a free demo of Achievers Listen today</a>.</p>

But money isn’t everything, and employees know it. In a </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alankohll/2018/07/10/what-employees-really-want-at-work/#92408125ad3b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">survey of talent trends</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, three things in particular rose to the top of employee wish lists: flexibility, wellness, and purpose.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">These perks are cultural, largely built into the ethos of a company rather than spelled out in a benefits package. It’s just one more bit of evidence leading to an overwhelming conclusion: Company culture matters.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2>The link between a strong culture and employee performance </h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A positive company culture is </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamcraig/2017/08/03/8-ways-company-culture-drives-performance/#5bb04bf06ce0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">linked to many favorable outcomes</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> for businesses, including increased innovation, better employee retention, and even an advantage in marketing, as more people are choosing to do business with companies they perceive to be doing good in the world.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">But the most important benefit of a strong company culture is its outsized impact on employee performance — indeed, improved employee performance is the driving force behind the other outcomes listed above. It’s not rocket science, either. A strong culture leads to happier employees, and </span><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/new_study_shows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">happier workers have been shown to be 12 percent more productive</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. A study of strong and weak organizational cultures points out that this </span><a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/strong-vs-weak-organizational-culture-assessing-the-impact-on-employeemotivation-.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">productivity boost is likely due to employee motivation</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, which increases significantly in companies where employee’s basic needs are met through a strong culture. Those needs, by the way, are the same as they are for all humans according to </span><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Maslow’s Hierarchy</span></a><span data-contrast="none">: basic physical needs for safety and comfort, as well as a feeling of belonging, self-esteem, and the chance to become the best you can be.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23555" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/02-11-20-b2.jpg" alt="The link between a strong culture and employee performance" width="750" height="250" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/02-11-20-b2.jpg 750w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/02-11-20-b2-300x100.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The feeling of belonging that comes with a strong company culture goes hand-in-hand with increased employee engagement — another strong driver of employee performance. </span><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Gallup has found</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> that companies with a highly engaged workforce achieve a 10 percent increase in customer satisfaction ratings and a 20 percent increase in sales, all of which leads to an overall boost in profitability of 21 percent.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2>Creating a positive culture </h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Every company has a culture. The question is: How will you ensure that your company culture is a positive one that supports your employees and leads to better outcomes?</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Building a strong company culture is an intentional act, and one that requires the concentrated effort of both the HR department and </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/6-ways-leadership-can-build-a-positive-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">the C-suite</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. As you work to build a stronger culture, these are some of the most important features to work on:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3>A shared sense of purpose </h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Workers want to feel that their company’s values match their own — yet </span><a href="https://www.bluleadz.com/blog/annual-digest-of-company-culture-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">33 percent of employees report a misalignment</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> that leaves them feeling disconnected from their work. The first step in building a strong company culture is to develop a mission statement that clearly articulates your purpose. </span><a href="https://cdn.imperative.com/media/public/Global_Purpose_Index_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Nearly 75 percent of purpose-focused workers are happy with their jobs</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, so defining your values and mission is a major step toward improving engagement and employee performance — it’s a step you cannot skip.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3>A culture of recognition </h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Regularly recognizing employees for their hard work is a crucial component of a successful company culture, as it makes people feel valued and integral to their company’s success. Social recognition programs have been shown to </span><a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">boost employee engagement and productivity to nearly double</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> of those companies without social recognition programs. Also, </span><a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/2020-engagement-retention-report/"><span data-contrast="none">90 percent</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> of workers say when they receive recognition it motivates them to work harder and 92 percent agree when they&#8217;re recognized for a specific action, they&#8217;re more likely to take that action again in the future.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For a deeper dive into how a strong recognition program can improve employee performance and engagement, read a case study on how </span><a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/general-motors-customer-success-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">General Motors (GM) launched a program that resulted in over 80,000 unique recognitions</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> being sent within 30 days. After GM&#8217;s program launch, employee recognition became one of the five most improved areas in the company&#8217;s engagement survey.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3>A responsive work environment </h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It’s remarkably easy to forget that your facilities are a major contributor to company culture. A </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2019/08/survey-what-employees-want-most-from-their-workspaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Harvard Business Review survey</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> found that over half of workers wanted good air quality and comfortable lighting in their workspaces. Remarkably, many people wanted basics like climate control and soothing soundscapes more than other perks or wellness benefits. This is low-hanging fruit: </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/how-to-design-a-workspace-that-boosts-employee-motivation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Design a comfortable and motivating (rather than just trendy) workspace</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> for your employees, and you’ll be doing a great deal to improve your overall culture as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23553" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/02-11-20-b.jpg" alt="A responsive work environment" width="750" height="250" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/02-11-20-b.jpg 750w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/02-11-20-b-300x100.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h3>A focus on cultural fit </h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Building a strong culture is a long game, and it can take years to develop. Fortunately, HR can support the process through hiring by making sure you bring on people who are the best fit for the values you wish to instill across your business. SHRM recommends </span><a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/toolkits/pages/understandinganddevelopingorganizationalculture.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">designing interview questions that specifically gauge how well candidates fit</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> into your established (or better yet, your aspirational) corporate culture to make sure every new worker enhances rather than detracts from it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The most effective way to strategize your culture plan is to assess how employees currently feel about your culture. You can’t begin to change until you can describe what you already have. The best way to get their </span><span data-contrast="none">opinions?</span><span data-contrast="none"> Ask! Gather honest </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/the-importance-of-regular-feedback/"><span data-contrast="none">employee feedback</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> to find out what’s working and what’s not. Be sure to ask for their suggestions for changes — then act on that input.

This is just human nature; ask anyone who spends hours of their free time breeding specialty orchids, tying flies for fly-fishing, or creating complex knitting patterns. Your challenge as a manager is to generate this same focused energy among your employees for their work tasks. Success in this endeavor for an engaged workforce is a basic necessity for any company&#8217;s financial resilience. With just <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/2020-engagement-retention-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19 percent</a> of employees who consider themselves &#8220;very engaged&#8221; at work, now is the time to to strengthen your understanding of why your company needs an engaged workforce. Here are seven good reasons why:</p>
<h2>1. Your business results will improve</h2>
<p>You may not see a direct line connecting your employee engagement level and your stock price, but it is there. According to an <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aptitude Research Partners report</a>, companies identified recognition as having the greatest impact on employee engagement. And companies that invest in social recognition see an improvement in business results across the board: four times more likely to improve stock prices, two times more likely to improve NPS scores, and two times more likely to improve individual performances. If you want to improve your bottom line, turn to <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/how-recognition-drives-employee-engagement-webinar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">employee recognition and engagement</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Bonus tip</strong>: Frequently recognize your employees to boost employee engagement. <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/2020-state-of-recognition-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Achievers data</a> shows that every time organizations double the number of recognitions in their organization, their overall engagement is expected to go up five percentage points.</p>
<h2>2. You will build customer loyalty</h2>
<p>Achievers’ Chief Customer Officer, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/unhappy-employees-unhappy-customers-how-to-break-the-lose-lose-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanessa Brangwyn</a>, states, &#8220;As an HR professional, the last thing you want is to lose customers because your employees are unmotivated, unfriendly, or unhelpful. However, trying to get your team to be nicer to people can be a complex task. Stressed or disengaged employees simply aren’t happy, and there’s no magic that will make an unhappy person empathize with customers. Instead, you have to use tried-and-true tools to improve the employee experience and transform your company culture<strong>.</strong>&#8221; Furthermore, customer experience expert, Blake Michelle Morgan, highlights some revealing statistics in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2018/02/23/the-un-ignorable-link-between-employee-experience-and-customer-experience/#c6cf38648dc1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article covering the link between employee experience and customer experience</a>: Employees at companies with excellent customer experience are 1 1/2 times more likely to be engaged, compared with workers at places with poor customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>An inspiring example</strong>: At <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/meijer-customer-success-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meijer</a>, increasing employee recognition from twice a month to twice a week yielded a five percent increase in customer satisfaction scores.</p>
<h2>3. Innovation will come naturally</h2>
<p>An engaged workforce tends to be more creative, and that results in productive suggestions for improvement. An <a href="http://apiar.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/APCAR_BRR710_BUS1-9.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extensive research review</a> on the topic reports that &#8220;there is a direct cause and effect relationship between employee engagement and organizational innovation.&#8221; This is because a management style that focuses on employee engagement is also going to be one that empowers its workers and listens to their ideas. The bonus of this approach is that the feedback you hear will not be limited to personnel issues. Instead, you&#8217;ll also open the spigot for fresh approaches across every department.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-23989 size-large" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kari-shea-QfAX7_xjxm4-unsplash-1024x684.jpg" alt="innovation" width="640" height="428" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kari-shea-QfAX7_xjxm4-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kari-shea-QfAX7_xjxm4-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kari-shea-QfAX7_xjxm4-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>4. Your employees will be healthier</h2>
<p>Remember that cartoon character with a personal rain cloud that followed everywhere they went? A <a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/187865/engaged-employees-less-likely-health-problems.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup study</a> proves that this effect exists in real life: Health comparisons between two groups of workers found that those who didn&#8217;t feel engaged in their work had higher blood pressure and stress levels throughout the day. They also had worse cholesterol levels, more physical pain, and were twice as likely to be clinically depressed. Furthermore, the effect of engagement on health is stronger than the effect of age. Disengaged workers between the ages of 20 and 29 report substantially more unhealthy days per month than do engaged workers between the ages of 50 and 79. These health statistics translate into hard cash for your company: An actively disengaged worker will cost your company <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/187865/engaged-employees-less-likely-health-problems.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">85 percent</a> more in lost productivity. Multiply this by everyone on your payroll, and the cost of not having an engaged workforce becomes all too real.</p>
<h2>5. You will have a safer workplace</h2>
<p>Disengaged employees aren&#8217;t paying attention to what&#8217;s happening around them, so the rate of accidents substantially increases. When <a href="http://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/191501/moneyball-business-employee-engagement-meta-analysis.aspx?g_source=WWWV7HP&amp;g_medium=topic&amp;g_campaign=tiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup</a> analyzed work units with below-average employee engagement, they found safety incidents 70 percent higher than in workplaces with above-average engagement. Neglecting safety procedures is serious in any industry and can lead to OSHA expenses and legal fees, but it&#8217;s particularly relevant in the healthcare industry. Patient safety incidents were 58 percent higher in provider locations with below-average engagement compared with places where workers are more highly engaged.</p>
<h2>6. You will attract talent</h2>
<p>These days, the quality of a company&#8217;s culture is no secret. <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glassdoor</a> and other review sites are a source of continuous conversation on social media, and everyone knows which employers are the rock stars. Companies need to have an effective strategy in place to attract top talent.  This is especially important given over <a href="https://jobbatical.com/resources/hiring-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">72 percent</a> of employers are having a difficult time finding skilled candidates and 45 percent of employers are concerned about finding employees with the necessary talents. </p>
<h2>7. Your best workers will stick around</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve seen the alarming statistics on the <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/the-true-cost-of-employee-disengagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of replacing employees</a>: replacing a worker can cost you anywhere from tens of thousands of dollars to twice the departed employee’s salary. However, beyond the statistics is the expensive, disruptive reality of worker turnover. Remaining employees often have to take on extra duties while you&#8217;re looking to replace the one you lost, and after the new person comes on board, team members end up doing a lot of informal training. Furthermore, a new employee can take up to <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/6-stats-that-speak-to-employee-retention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two full years</a> to reach the same level of productivity as an existing staff member.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22993" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/01-13-20-2-1024x582.jpg" alt="engaged workforce" width="640" height="364" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/01-13-20-2-1024x582.jpg 1024w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/01-13-20-2-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/01-13-20-2-768x436.jpg 768w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/01-13-20-2.jpg 1130w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>An engaged workforce is your key to success</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) describes the <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/toolkits/pages/sustainingemployeeengagement.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">critical benefits of employee engagement</a>: &#8220;Executives from around the world say that enhancing employee engagement is one of their top five global business strategies. Not only does engagement have the potential to significantly affect employee retention, productivity, and loyalty, it is also a key link to customer satisfaction, company reputation, and overall stakeholder value.&#8221;</p>

It’s no surprise that 65% of employers <a href="https://www.shrm.org/about-shrm/press-room/press-releases/pages/survey-how-covid-19-is-changing-the-workplace.aspx">had trouble maintaining morale</a> during these trying times. When morale is low, performance suffers and <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/08/the-key-to-happy-customers-happy-employees">customer satisfaction drops</a>. Thankfully, there’s plenty you can do to boost morale. Here’s some of the biggest culprits when it comes to unhappy employees and eight of the best ways to boost morale.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-culture-report/"><em><strong>Find out how to build a culture that keeps employees happy and engaged in this free report.</strong></em></a></p>
<h2>What causes low employee morale?</h2>
<p>Employee morale is complex, and what matters to one team member might not have any impact on another. But there are some core factors that can bring morale down across the board:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Burnout</strong>. Burnout is incredibly unpleasant for both employees and employers. And according to a recent report by Indeed, <a href="https://www.indeed.com/lead/preventing-employee-burnout-report">52% of workers</a> are feeling burned out in our post-pandemic world.</li>
<li><strong>Poor leadership</strong>. Few things have a greater impact on the employee experience than managers and company leadership. Micromanagement, a lack of transparency, and many other negative factors can reduce the morale of entire teams.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of growth opportunities</strong>. If you don’t see ways to keep developing at your organization, chances are you won’t be thrilled about working there. <a href="https://www.indeed.com/lead/preventing-employee-burnout-report">Millennials especially value opportunities for professional development</a> — 60% would forego regular pay raises for a job with the potential for great development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s take a look at what you can do to keep these factors in check.</p>
<h2>Top 6 ways to boost employee morale</h2>
<p>Recognition, feedback, wellness — focusing on these and other important parts of the employee experience is the key to high morale.</p>
<h3>1. Prioritize employee recognition</h3>
<p>Employees who feel appreciated feel happy. While a simple “thank you” goes a long way, making recognition a consistent morale booster requires much more. It starts with encouraging frequent recognition so everyone gets in the habit. And leaders play a key role in this effort.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“As a leader, your recognition goes a long way. Whether it&#8217;s celebrating a milestone or giving a simple thank you note, every recognition has the power to impact employee engagement and morale.” &#8211; <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/why-leaders-need-to-be-recognition-champions/">Jeff Cates, CEO and President, Achievers</a></em></p>
<p>When you recognize frequently, in real time, it becomes that much easier to make recognition personal. By linking appreciation to specific behaviors, you encourage employees to repeat them. In fact, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">92% of employees</a> say that they’re more likely to repeat actions they’re recognized for.</p>
<p>It all boils down to building a culture of recognition where everyone feels connected as <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/how-recognition-boosts-community-4-must-know-tips/">part of a community</a>. To accomplish this, you need a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-software/">comprehensive recognition solution</a>. Look for one that lets team members show appreciation anywhere, anytime, with an intuitive user interface and robust mobile capabilities. A platform also makes publicizing recognition easy through a company-wide newsfeed and the ability to like, comment on, or award additional points (“boost”) specific recognitions. And personalization becomes that much simpler when you can add related gifs or photos.</p>
<h3>2. Give employees a voice</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Few things are more demoralizing than feeling like your opinion doesn’t matter. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">Employees want a voice</a>, and they want employers to listen when they speak. Soliciting and acting on feedback <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/case-studies/coborns-customer-success-story/">increases engagement as well</a>, and keeping employees motivated is just as important as keeping them happy.</p>
<p>Talking to employees in person and asking for their input is great, but it’s not likely to reveal their true feelings. If you want the insights from your surveys to be relevant and actionable, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/taking-the-pulse-of-employee-engagement/">you need to deliver them frequently</a>, not just once a year. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">Pulse surveys</a> — short, focused questionnaires — are the answer, together with an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">always-on feedback channel</a> that lets team members provide feedback whenever they have something to say. Look for a voice of the employee solution that provides both, and that guides managers as they create collaborative action plans with their teams to address problems feedback reveals.</p>
<p><em>“Long-term stress can cause anger, irritability, headaches and sadness, as well as chronic susceptibility to viruses and infections. If your workplace fosters tension, it’s time to gather employee feedback and ask your team how the workflow needs to change.” &#8211; <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/unhappy-employees-unhappy-customers-how-to-break-the-lose-lose-cycle/">Vanessa Brangwyn, Chief Customer Officer, Achievers</a></em></p>
<h3>3. Support health and wellness</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that organizations need to support employees’ mental and physical health, but many haven’t risen to the task in these trying times. Anxiety <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2020/10/08/mental-health-leadership-survey-reveals-80-of-remote-workers-would-quit-their-jobs-for-this/#872f6943a0f7">caused the majority of U.S. employees to struggle in 2020</a>, and almost half say their mental health has suffered while working remotely.</p>
<p>How can you promote wellness at your company? Start by understanding what efforts will make the most impact. You’ll need employee feedback to get a truly accurate picture — while 80% of employers believe they’re supporting employee wellness, <a href="https://hrexecutive.com/3-steps-to-thrive-not-just-survive-during-covid-19/">only 46% of employees agree</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Our understanding of the mental wellbeing of those around us is no longer about talking about change, but truly listening and acting on this intel. Empathy is our data set and it’s time we started using it to create sustainable momentum to lower levels of work-induced strain.” &#8211; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sallypercy/2020/10/10/how-to-be-a-mental-health-leader-for-your-team/?sh=328d1c957513">Mimi Nicklin, Millennial Author and Thought Leader</a></em></p>
<p>Giving employees adequate resources, providing the flexibility and time off needed for a healthy work-life balance, and encouraging physical activity are all <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/5-science-backed-ways-to-support-employee-wellbeing-through-covid-19/">fantastic ways to support employee wellbeing</a>. You can also reward employees who adopt healthy habits and meet their wellness goals. Find a rewards solution that <a href="https://www.achievers.com/press/achievers-launches-integration-with-wellright-to-streamline-employee-rewards-recognition-and-wellness/">integrates with wellness tools</a> to make recognizing your wellness superstars easy.</p>
<p>To improve your employees’ mental health, help them <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/4-tips-cultivate-mindfulness-work/">practice mindfulness</a> and self-awareness. These skills enable team members to stay in tune with their emotions and better address them. You can also <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/mental-health-at-work-lean-into-it/">train team members on emotional intelligence</a> — especially managers — to build an empathetic, close-knit workforce.</p>

<h3>4. Live your culture and values</h3>
<p>Employees who <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/organizational-culture-definition/">buy into your culture</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/company-core-value-examples/">believe in your values</a> are happy to be a part of your company. Look out for ways to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/business-case-culture-alignment/">keep your culture aligned</a> with your employees’ expectations and needs. Leaders — especially managers — play a critical role here. Most employees say that managers have the <a href="https://www.benefitspro.com/2020/10/08/culture-matters-employees-sound-off-on-the-ideal-workplace/">primary responsibility for establishing company culture</a>. To keep managers accountable for building the culture you want to see, ensure that they live your values on a daily basis and actively engage with employees on key aspects of your culture.</p>
<p>You should make a safe, welcoming environment a core part of your culture as well. In an organization that <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/psychological-safety-at-work/">prioritizes psychological safety</a>, employees are comfortable being themselves and expressing their opinions. Removing this huge source of potential stress does wonders for morale.</p>
<h3>5. Emphasize communication and connection</h3>
<p>In this era of remote work and disconnection, building a sense of community throughout your organization is <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/information-sharing-why-transparency-and-communication-are-crucial-in-a-crisis/">more important than ever</a>. A startling one-third of employees now f<a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/infographic-feelings-of-connection-during-covid-19/">eel disconnected from their team members and company culture</a>. This has a significant impact on morale: 44% of employees <a href="https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/measure-remote-employee-engagement/">experience lower morale due to isolation</a>.</p>
<p>Encouraging transparent communication is a great way to counteract this. When employees can quickly access important information and see that leadership works to stay authentic <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/how-to-approach-difficult-conversations-at-work/">no matter what they’re discussing</a>, they’ll view the company — and their role within it — more positively. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/6-techniques-improve-way-employees-communicate/">Using tools that make communication easy</a>, no matter where team members find themselves, helps your employees stay connected as well.</p>
<h3>6. Build trust by empowering your employees</h3>
<p>Trust is the foundation of any successful workplace. Unfortunately, only <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/empowerment-and-trust-the-keys-to-employee-engagement/">21% of HR professionals and leaders</a> believe that employees really trust their organization’s leadership. It’s hard to keep your spirits up when you don’t believe in those who are setting the agenda.</p>
<p>The best way to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/building-trust-workplace/">establish mutual trust</a> with employees is by demonstrating your trust in them through <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-empowerment/">employee empowerment</a>. Instead of micromanaging, give employees space. Instead of doing everything yourself, coach and delegate. Employees thrive when they have the resources, autonomy, and authority they need to succeed. They won’t forget who made that success possible, and they&#8217;ll show trust in you and the company in return.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/3-ways-promote-professional-growth/">Supporting professional development</a> is an integral part of empowering your employees and building trust. Offering everyone at your organization the possibility of advancement along clear career paths, providing opportunities for continuous learning and knowledge sharing, and even supporting sensible lateral moves are just some of the ways you can keep your team members from feeling that they’ve hit a dead end.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">So what’s t</span><span data-contrast="none">he best way to measure employee engagement</span><span data-contrast="auto">? Shouldn’t we just ask them how engaged they are? While surveys </span><span data-contrast="auto">are</span><span data-contrast="auto"> definitely useful, they have to be short and frequent, and </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">designed in a way that elicits authentic responses</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">You can also measure your company’s productivity KPIs, but you have to be sure to hold all the possible factors constant. If productivity goes up, you need to narrow down on enough data to rule out other causes, such as better equipment or a new schedule or countless other moving parts of a complex system. To simplify this challenge, we decided to look at one specific behavior that’s characteristic of engaged employees: How often they give and receive recognition.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, how do we k</span><span data-contrast="auto">now that recognition is a reliable indicator of employee engagement?

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Since listening to employees is only half the story when it comes to building engagement, it’s also important to look at the other half: acting on the feedback that you receive.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Employee recognition platforms make it easy to build a sustainable culture of recognition. They offer flexible ways to express appreciation, including both social and monetary options, and they let recognition flow horizontally (peer to peer) as well as vertically (between manager and worker).

The number of large multinational enterprises worldwide (with revenues of at least $200 billion) is expected to reach </span><a href="https://www.relocatemagazine.com/multinationals-and-globally-mobile-employees-growing-apace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">13,900</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, with uncountable numbers of smaller organizations also building networks across borders. “The psychological and emotional reaction people experience when participating on these teams can sink its effectiveness.” This warning comes from Andy Molinsky, a global business consultant and Brandeis University professor, writing in </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2018/05/how-to-keep-a-global-team-engaged" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Harvard Business Review</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. At </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Achievers</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, we demonstrate every day that team alignment is possible regardless of geographic distance through a global </span><span data-contrast="auto">employee engagement </span><span data-contrast="auto">program. Here are the five keys to making this type of program a success.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">Listen to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">y</span><span data-contrast="auto">our </span><span data-contrast="auto">e</span><span data-contrast="auto">mployees</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When your workforce is spread across time zones, it’s essential to make sure you’re listening to everyone. Andy Molinsky states, “Employees far away from headquarters often have less access to the team leader. As a result, they may have a harder time getting their concerns noticed and attended to.” When you keep an </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/what-we-offer/listen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">active listening channel</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> always open, and combine it with brief pulse surveys, you’ll maintain a clear awareness of how each individual team member is doing. Engagement depends on each employee feeling valued, and if you can’t be there to walk past their desk every day, you should do the next best thing: Use HR technology to reach out and connect. A single-click daily poll and confidential questions about how everyone is doing is a way to cross the cultural divide and help global employees feel safe about expressing their needs.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22207" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/09_27_2019_4-1024x582.jpg" alt="employee feedback" width="640" height="364" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/09_27_2019_4-1024x582.jpg 1024w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/09_27_2019_4-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/09_27_2019_4-768x436.jpg 768w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/09_27_2019_4.jpg 1130w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">Personalize </span><span data-contrast="auto">y</span><span data-contrast="auto">our </span><span data-contrast="auto">a</span><span data-contrast="auto">ctions</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One benefit offered by an active listening interface is that you receive a clear blueprint for taking personalized actions. </span><a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/personalization-the-missing-link-in-employee-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Personalization is vital</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> in today’s workforce, and it becomes even more important when you’re managing a team that’s spread across time zones and cultural norms. An incentive that works well for a 55-year-old employee in San Francisco may not be all that attractive to a 25-year-old worker in Delhi. Your company benefits from a diversity of skill sets, but successfully running a global company means building a sense of community across your entire workforce. The right advanced technology recommends personalized bite-sized actions that you don’t have to spend a lot of time trying to figure out from scratch. </span><span data-contrast="auto">As you build out your global employee engagement program, think about new and creative ways to personalize your actions.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">Build </span><span data-contrast="auto">c</span><span data-contrast="auto">ommunity with </span><span data-contrast="auto">r</span><span data-contrast="auto">ecognition </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Team-building is all about mutual recognition. When employees have the opportunity to give each other recognition</span><span data-contrast="auto">, it clearly communicates the fact that everyone is working together. Digital celebration cards and reward points can flash across the globe in a matter of seconds, bringing a sense of unity and belonging throughout your company. Scotiabank is a great example of this phenomenon. With 90,000 global employees, and locations in North America, Latin America, the Caribbean and Central America, and the Asia-Pacific, company-wide engagement was an ongoing challenge. After </span><span data-contrast="none">instituting their </span><a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/using-recognition-to-drive-engagement-a-best-practice-guide-with-scotiabank-webinar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span data-contrast="none">Applause 2.0</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> recognition program</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, powered by Achievers, Scotiabank decided to up their recognition game by adding an annual 2-week </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Pay it Forward</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> campaign. During the campaign period, employees were empowered to express appreciation to their team members with reward points. The results demonstrate how the right channel can build a powerful sense of community, regardless of location. During the most recent </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Pay it Forward</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> campaign, employees sent over 47,000 recognitions, and worldwide employee activation of the platform reached 86 percent.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Scaling a global employee engagement program remotely, and attracting the participation of workers across the world definitely poses some challenges. The concept of inclusiveness &#8212; making sure everyone has equivalent access from day one &#8212; is key to scaling the right way. </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/HCTrends2018/2018-HCtrends_Rise-of-the-social-enterprise.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Deloitte’s Global Human Capital Trends report</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> found that that “65 percent of CEOs rated “inclusive growth” as a top-three strategic concern, more than three times greater than the proportion citing “shareholder value.” The researchers note that “organizations today are increasingly judged on the basis of their relationships with their workers,” and that large corporations are becoming “social enterprises.” Inclusiveness refers to more than simply location: 50 percent of respondents in Deloitte’s survey report that they employ a large number of contract workers, while 23 percent utilize the services of freelancers. In the U.S., the survey reports, 40 percent of employees now work in some kind of alternative work arrangement, and these trends are growing globally. The Deloitte report emphasizes “To drive real value through the new workforce ecosystem, organizations need to understand how to appeal to and engage with workers of all kinds.”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></p>

In a changing world, disconnection and stress are significant risks your organization needs to address — because when employee wellness suffers, so does your company’s bottom line. Unexpected absences <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/070513/causes-and-costs-absenteeism.asp">cost organization’s between $2,600 to $3,600 per year</a> for the average employee. Many of the common factors that contribute to employee absenteeism — including illness, burnout, and depression — are directly linked to employees’ physical and emotional wellness.</p>
<p>With the wellness program tips and ideas below, you’ll have everything you need to create a healthy workforce at your organization.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/5-science-backed-ways-to-support-employee-wellbeing-through-covid-19/"><strong><em>Discover how to keep your workforce resilient and connected in this free webinar.</em></strong></a></p>
<h2>Creating wellness programs</h2>
<p>A wellness program is any initiative designed to improve an aspect of employees’ emotional or physical health. These two pieces of the wellness puzzle are linked and reinforcing: employees who eat well, exercise, and avoid unhealthy physical habits are likely to be healthier mentally, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Getting any wellness initiative off the ground requires some legwork. You need to ensure the relevant stakeholders in your organization, from the executive level on down, understand the value of employee wellness and buy into what you’re trying to achieve. Data on the current state of employee wellness, as well as related aspects of the employee experience, can help. You should also create a wellness committee that’s responsible for overseeing and implementing wellness programs at your company.</p>
<p>After starting wellness programs, you should keep an eye on how they perform so you can make necessary improvements and demonstrate their impact to key stakeholders. The best way to do this is by soliciting feedback from employees. Conduct pulse surveys focused on your programs, together with an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">always on feedback channel</a> that employees can use to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">express their voice at any time</a>. This provides you with accurate data in real time that you can <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">quickly analyze and act on</a> to keep your wellness programs effective and relevant.</p>
<p>You should also connect wellness programs to your <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/company-core-value-examples/">company values and mission</a>, so your employees see that your organization practices what it preaches. Employees are more likely to prioritize their own wellness if they see that it’s a key part of <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/organizational-culture-definition/">your organizational culture</a>.</p>
<h2>10 ideas for employee wellness programs</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to boost employee wellness across your organization, try some of the winning programs discussed below.</p>
<h2>1. Rewarding and incentivizing wellness</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">Ninety-two percent of employees are more likely to repeat behavior they’re recognized for</a>, so start recognizing your employees for their wellness wins!</p>
<p>Wellness incentives shouldn’t take the form of one-size-fits-all rewards like mugs or t-shirts provided on an ad hoc basis. Not only will these rewards mean little to employees, it requires a significant amount of effort on the part of managers and HR to manually track and recognize employees’ wellness progress.</p>
<p>Make the process easy with an employee reward and recognition solution that <a href="https://www.achievers.com/press/achievers-launches-integration-with-wellright-to-streamline-employee-rewards-recognition-and-wellness/">integrates with a wellness platform</a> instead. Everyone at your organization can then automatically earn reward points when they achieve wellness goals and milestones tracked in the platform. Since they can redeem these points in a centralized rewards marketplace for products and experiences they actually want, they’ll remain motivated to practice healthy habits on and off the job.</p>
<h2>2. Combating burnout</h2>
<p>Burnout is a chronic problem at many organizations, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sallypercy/2020/10/10/how-to-be-a-mental-health-leader-for-your-team/?sh=7b777b4e7513">especially in our new normal</a>. If your company is serious about wellness, fighting burnout has to be at the top of your agenda.</p>
<p>Start by gathering data to reveal the state of burnout at your organization and what’s causing it, preferably using tools like anonymous pulse surveys. Sources of burnout might include overwork, lack of necessary support or resources, or unfair treatment. Don’t disregard what you discover, even if it reveals uncomfortable truths about your organization’s work environment.</p>
<p>After you’ve identified the causes of burnout at your company, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/burnout-job/">implement the necessary measures to fight them</a>, at both the organization and team levels. Prioritize transparent communication, support work-life balance, and address feedback from employees quickly to minimize the effects of burnout at your company.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/employee-burnout-signs-and-action-steps-to-prevent-or-mitigate-its-impact/"><em><strong>Learn the signs of burnout and how to fight it in this free webinar.</strong></em></a></p>
<h2>3. Flexibility and time off</h2>
<p>Giving employees flexibility in how and when they work is a must, especially given the increased prevalence of remote work. Empowering employees with the autonomy to get the job done in the way that fits them best — without negatively impacting the rest of their team, of course — has big wellness benefits. Together with purpose and connection, it’s one of the <a href="https://www.toolbox.com/hr/employee-wellness/news/flexibility-purpose-and-connection-gartner-identifies-pillars-of-new-employer-employee-relationship/">three pillars of employee wellness identified by Gartner</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond flexibility in terms of time and location, give employees more freedom in what tasks they handle and how they complete those tasks. Variety is the spice of life, especially at work, so even if it’s just taking on a new responsibility for a few days, changing things up can <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/5-ways-wellness-programs-can-enhance-employee-engagement/">renew engagement</a> and stave off burnout.</p>
<p>Providing employees with enough time to recharge is just as important as providing control over how they work. When work-life balance is skewed, you feel burned out and exhausted. It’s hard to prioritize other wellness practices when you’re in that state.</p>
<p>Clearly communicate that employees should use their PTO when they need it as well. Make sure employees know that using PTO is not only acceptable but encouraged. Emphasize to managers that balancing workloads to facilitate time off is a priority.</p>
<h2>4. Encouraging mindfulness</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/mindfulness-at-work-culture-of-mindful-leadership-empathy/">Practicing mindfulness</a> gives employees the self-awareness they need to combat the daily stressors everyone experiences. They’ll learn to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/awareness-key-to-healthy-teams/">get in touch with how they’re feeling in the moment</a> and take the time to process those feelings before they act. With the understanding of themselves and others mindfulness provides, employees can <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/7-ways-de-stress-workplace/">respond to stressors</a> thoughtfully and constructively.</p>
<p>You can direct employees to available mindfulness resources and even start offering mindfulness training to unlock its benefits for your workforce. Consider complementing these efforts with training on <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/why-emotional-intelligence-is-a-critical-skill-for-your-future-workforce/">emotional intelligence</a> — an individual’s ability to empathize with others. Successful managers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogertrapp/2019/07/30/managers-at-last-see-value-in-emotional-intelligence/?sh=7b7864073515">need more than a high IQ</a> to connect with their team members and build a healthy culture.</p>
<h2>5. Fitness</h2>
<p>It’s hard to overstate the importance of fitness. A healthy lifestyle delivers benefits in every area of your life, including work. And no matter what your organization’s budget is, there are plenty of ways it can promote fitness.</p>
<p>Offering an on-site fitness center or sports area is an amazing perk that’s sure to boost employee fitness, but it requires a significant investment of resources. Starting fitness clubs at your organization around activities that team members enjoy can be just as effective, as can offering or paying for fitness classes. And reimbursing employees for the cost of gym or health club memberships is a simple, tangible way to show your investment in their fitness.</p>
<h2>6. Health services</h2>
<p>It can be a struggle to find time in your busy schedule to seek out the medical services you know you should. That’s why organizations should help team members get the care they need to stay healthy and productive.</p>
<p>To get more employees to take advantage of necessary health services, make it easy for them. There’s a huge range of services your organization can help provide, such as health risk assessments, health coaching, and in-office flu shots. These initiatives demonstrate that your organization cares about its employees’ wellbeing, and they’ll lead to a healthier and happier workforce.</p>

<h2>7. Education</h2>
<p>It’s hard to practice healthy habits when you don’t know what they are, so educating your workforce is a key step on the path to wellness. In addition to educating employees on major topics like preventative care, you can also combat misinformation on issues like vaccination safety. There are many great third party resources available in the form of webinars, blogs, and online newsletters for you to use.</p>
<h2>8. Encouraging healthy eating habits</h2>
<p>We are what we eat. Relying on unhealthy comfort foods can sap employees’ energy and leave them feeling disengaged and lethargic, so do what you can to make eating healthy fun and easy for your employees.</p>
<p>Explore all available options on this front to find the best fit for your team. Ordering a healthy, tasty lunch for them on a regular basis is a great idea, as is providing healthy snacking options for the entire office. If your workforce is remote, you can send the snacks to them, or reimburse them for sourcing food from healthy providers, like local farmers’ markets. Educating employees on what healthy eating actually looks like, as well as on restaurants that offer healthy choices in the area, is also valuable.</p>
<h2>9. Smoking cessation programs</h2>
<p>Smoking remains one of the biggest health hazards facing individuals today, and second-hand smoke poses a danger to other team members. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/index.htm">Over one-fifth of annual deaths in the U.S.</a> are linked to the effects of smoking.</p>
<p>Despite the dangers posed by smoking, don’t make employees feel guilty. Instead, offer a helping hand and provide them with the resources they need to quit. Coaching, support groups, and reimbursement for the cost of quitting-related techniques and products are all excellent ways to support employees who want to stop smoking.</p>
<h2>10. Transit</h2>
<p>How your employees get to and from work affects their own health and the health of the environment. Instead of driving to work alone, employees can carpool and build camaraderie, bike and get in extra exercise, or use public transportation and ease traffic congestion. Encourage these initiatives by rewarding employees who participate and covering the cost of related equipment and services.</p>

Thankfully, ever-advancing HR tech is up to the task. From keeping employees engaged no matter where they’re located to driving performance using AI and data analytics, here are 5 of the key HR technology trends your organization needs to keep up with in 2021.</p>
<h2>1. Elevate the employee experience with self-service tools</h2>
<p>Self-service tools empower all your team members, from staff to managers to executives, with capabilities that were formerly the sole domain of HR. For instance, an employee portal lets your workforce access tax information and documents, enroll in health plans, and view pay stubs. But this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>The true impact of self-service tools — and the reason they’re a major HR technology trend — comes from involving everyone in a culture of recognition, establishing always-on lines of communication with employees, and giving managers access to the data they need to act on employee feedback. With training from HR and an intuitive user interface, employees quickly make these platforms part of their routine and enjoy engaging with them on a daily basis.</p>
<h3>Show appreciation with a recognition platform</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/using-recognition-to-boost-motivation-during-an-economic-downturn/">Recognized employees are motivated employees</a>, but providing the occasional years-of-service award or branded swag won’t make an impact. Realizing the full benefits of recognition means getting everyone involved in showing appreciation frequently. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">Organizations that provide frequent recognition</a> are 41% more likely to see improved employee retention and 34% more likely to see improved employee engagement.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/"><strong><em>Discover the business impact of inclusive and frequent recognition enabled by technology.</em></strong></a></p>
<p>Your organization needs to make recognition easy, which is why so many have adopted a comprehensive reward and recognition (R&amp;R) platform. Cutting-edge R&amp;R platforms combine both social and monetary recognition features in a single platform that can be accessed from anywhere, thanks to robust mobile capabilities. With the click of a button, team members can send customized messages of recognition to anyone at your organization. Your team members can even include reward points with every message of recognition, and the recipients can then redeem them for rewards of their choosing. This streamlines the reward process and ensures that every reward is personalized and meaningful.</p>
<p>These tools make the recognition experience engaging by allowing employees to like and comment on other messages, turning appreciation into a fun, communal experience. Those who use Achievers Recognize — a comprehensive recognition solution — <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">were 107% more likely to give their culture of recognition a high rating</a> than organizations that don’t use recognition technology.</p>
<p>The self-service aspect of R&amp;R platforms is the key to getting the most out of recognition. When team members show appreciation on a regular basis, its impact increases exponentially. And when you recognize employees in real time, clearly linking recognition to a specific action, your team members are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/">more likely to take that action again</a>. R&amp;R platforms make it easy for team members to engage in these best practices. They’re a truly revolutionary tool for transforming organizational culture and boosting the employee experience.</p>
<h3>Listen to your workforce with an employee engagement solution</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">Employees want their voices heard</a>, no matter whether they’re in-office or working remotely. But employees can’t express what they truly feel over chat or email, as these channels don’t offer anonymity. And even if they do, managers and HR will lack the guidance on how to effectively respond to this feedback quickly, so employees will only be demoralized by what they perceive as a lack of action. Your organization must provide every team member with the ability to send confidential feedback at any time, and it must give management the tools it needs to rapidly analyze and take effective action on feedback.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">Employee engagement platforms</a> meet this need. They offer everything required to keep the feedback loop going, starting with pulse surveys — relatively short questionnaires that focus on specific engagement factors. Pulse surveys take far less time to complete than a traditional annual survey, boosting participation rates. And you can use them to survey your employees frequently, keeping tabs on engagement in real time.</p>
<p>When employees have important feedback in-between pulse surveys — or regarding something your pulse surveys haven’t addressed — the best engagement platforms provide a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">self-service, always-on feedback channel</a>, thanks to the power of AI. With an intelligent HR chatbot that learns by interacting with employees, checks in with them, and lets them reach out anonymously at any time, you’ll always know what your workforce is thinking. You’ll discover cultural dynamics that were previously hidden, and you’ll be able to tell whether your HR initiatives are having the desired result over time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/"><strong><em>Download this free report on the science behind AI-powered HR chatbots.</em></strong></a></p>
<p>These self-service capabilities extend to the analytics side as well. Managers need to be the ones to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">act on their team’s feedback</a> — after all, they have the greatest control over the day-to-day experience of their direct reports. A comprehensive employee engagement solution includes robust analytics tools like customized reports and heatmaps. These make it easy to identify trends, find out where your organization or team is underperforming, and see where its strengths lie. Employee engagement platforms can even guide managers through to a meeting with their team, where they can present their findings and build a collaborative action plan that everyone buys into.</p>
<h2>2. Analyze data to drive performance</h2>
<p>HR now has the technology to collect more data than ever before — and that can be a problem. With information on everything from recruitment to performance, separating the signal from the noise isn’t always easy. You need to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/hr-metrics/">identify the metrics that truly matter to your organization</a> and then track and improve them.</p>
<p>First, consider the major areas you want to prioritize to improve business performance. These may include engagement and recognition, as discussed above, as well as recruitment, retention, training, and revenue. Then work with relevant stakeholders — from employees on the front lines to managers and executives — to collaboratively come up with <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/how-to-measure-employee-engagement/">key performance indicators (KPIs) that are meaningful to everyone</a>. These KPIs can range from measures of individual performance, like how many goals of different types were met by each employee, to organization-wide indicators, like monthly activity on your recognition platform.</p>
<p>It’s not feasible for HR to sort through this data manually when they have many other pressing responsibilities. Look for tools that respect your time with automated data collection and easy-to-use analytics features, like dashboards and customizable reports. And if possible, integrate your tech in a single platform, so you can access all your organization’s data and key insights in one place.</p>
<h2>3. Lean into our remote work reality</h2>
<p>The transition to remote work isn’t slowing down. Remote employees have more flexibility in how, when, and where they work, and remote organizations enjoy reduced overhead and the ability to recruit without geographic restrictions. But remote work also comes with challenges — communicating effectively, collaborating with other team members, and feeling isolated from the organization and its culture.</p>
<p>HR can <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/remote-employee-engagement/">help remote team members remain connected and productive</a>, with the right technology. You should first ensure you’ve provided all team members with software that enables and streamlines digital communication. This includes tools like Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, and Zoom that let employees connect face-to-face at the click of a button, as well as intuitive chat tools like Slack. Video call platforms are also a must for remote interviewing and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/onboarding-remote-employees/">onboarding</a>.</p>
<p>HR technology for remote work doesn’t end with communication tools. Out-of-office collaboration requires a project management platform that gives all team members visibility into where projects stand at any given time. The notification and commenting capabilities that come with project management software also make remote teamwork much smoother. Employee portals, as touched on above, are another great tool for your remote workforce. They let team members handle complicated administrative tasks virtually without having to engage in lengthy email or chat sessions with HR.</p>
<h2>4. Use software to encourage employee wellness</h2>
<p>The unfortunate truth is that employees are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sallypercy/2020/10/10/how-to-be-a-mental-health-leader-for-your-team/?sh=7b777b4e7513">suffering from more stress than ever before</a>. That’s why organizations need to prioritize supporting employee wellness. Educating employees on key ways to improve both mental and physical health, like practicing mindfulness and staying fit, together with providing the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/burnout-job/">resources and support to prevent burnout</a>, is a great place to start. But the best organizations leverage HR technology to boost their efforts using an employee wellness platform.</p>
<p>Look for a platform that takes a holistic approach to addressing employee wellness, as emotional and physical health are inextricably linked. It should offer health assessments that help employees understand where they’re at, make tracking progress towards wellness goals easy, and reward employees for clearing personal wellness challenges. The latter is easily automated by <a href="https://www.achievers.com/press/achievers-launches-integration-with-wellright-to-streamline-employee-rewards-recognition-and-wellness/">selecting a wellness platform that integrates with your R&amp;R solution</a>. Rather than giving employees rewards that you have to select yourself and may not mean much to them, your workforce can earn points by achieving wellness goals and then redeem those points for whatever they prefer from a fully-stocked digital marketplace.</p>
<h2>5. Support continuous learning and development</h2>
<p>Investing in your employees is a win-win for them and your company. Your team members can pursue their professional interests and grow in their careers while your organization reaps the rewards of a more skilled workforce. With advancements in HR technology, fostering professional development throughout the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-life-cycle/">entire employee life cycle</a> is easier than ever.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/5-ways-to-engage-employees-through-learning-and-development/">options for using technology to assist employee learning</a> are almost limitless, from gamification to eLearning to virtual reality. Using a learning management system, or LMS, that enables individualized training for all team members is a great start. An LMS lets you make self-created or third party courses available through a mobile-friendly platform, so team members can complete lessons both on and off the job. Look for an LMS that provides monitoring and reporting features for tracking learners’ progress and ensuring your organization is meeting its development goals.</p>
<h2>Stay ahead of the curve with a comprehensive employee experience solution</h2>
<p>When it comes to HR technology, few things are more impactful than an integrated employee experience platform designed to boost both engagement and recognition. And that’s exactly what Achievers provides, in the form of its two complementary tools, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/">Achievers Recognize</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/listen/">Achievers Listen</a>.

While there are many advantages of having a multigenerational workforce, such as fostering innovation and mentorships, managing such a diverse group of employees also has its challenges.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These generations all have different skillsets and employment goals and finding a way to bridge the gap between them is not an easy task. One thing, however, that all generations have in common is the desire for recognition. No matter their age or what generation they were born into, your employees want recognition for their hard work and commitment to the company. According to a recent </span><a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/2020-engagement-retention-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Achievers report</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, 82 percent of employees wish they received more recognition for their work and 60 percent want to be recognized more frequently than they are. Additionally, o</span>rganizations that give frequent recognition are <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 percent</a> more likely to see increased employee retention and 34 percent more likely to see increased employee engagement</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The good news is that not only does employee recognition span generations, it also can help to promote employee engagement, which can boost performance (</span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">by 20 percent</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">), increase sales (</span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/recognize-your-employees-and-strengthen-your-bottom-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">by 50 percent</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">), improve retention (</span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/recognize-your-employees-and-strengthen-your-bottom-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">by 21 percent</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">), and strengthen revenue growth (</span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">2.5x greater</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">).</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">Are you ready to recognize your multigenerational workforce? Get started with our seven tips:</span></p>
<h2>1. Global recognition kickoff</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whether you’re starting a new recognition program or revamping your current one, the best way to start is to organize a global recognition kickoff. Be sure to make it a company-wide program that involves workers from all levels within the workplace, including part-time, temporary, and remote workers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With a new frequent and meaningful employee recognition strategy in the works, make sure to communicate the importance and benefits of recognition across your entire multigenerational workforce, especially the ones in management roles. </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/why-leaders-need-to-be-recognition-champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Recognition from managers and leaders</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is extremely important given </span><a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/2020-engagement-retention-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">40 percent</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> of employees answered just &#8220;okay&#8221; and nearly one in five said &#8220;horrible&#8221; when asked how their company or manager is at recognizing them. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To help with your company&#8217;s transition to a culture of recognition, it’s important to promote the new recognition program throughout the company in the weeks leading up to the kickoff. By building excitement, even before launching the employee recognition program, you can encourage employee participation from day one.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23531" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/02-11-20-3.jpg" alt="multigenerational workforce recognition " width="750" height="250" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/02-11-20-3.jpg 750w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/02-11-20-3-300x100.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h2>2. Simplified platform </h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It cannot be stressed enough that you need to make the recognition process as easy as possible. Not only are your workers busy, but your multigenerational workforce includes employees of all technological-skill levels. Keep this in mind when creating your recognition program.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You want to use an </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/what-we-offer/recognize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">employee recognition platform</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that even non-tech-savvy employees can use. In addition, find a platform that allows employees to offer peer-to-peer or manager-to-employee recognition in just a matter of minutes. These tips will enable you to create a program that allows all generations to participate in giving and receiving recognition.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Get your hands on an employee recognition platform that gives your real-time data and insights. General Motors (GM) is able to measure their global recognition program&#8217;s success. Within 30 days of launch, 87 percent of the entire global population was active in the platform, sending over 80,000 unique recognitions. Access the </span><a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/general-motors-customer-success-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">GM case study</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to learn more.</span></p>
<h2>3. Make it personal</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While employee recognition may span generations, it’s still important to respect your employees’ differences. One of the best ways to tailor your recognition program for your multigenerational workforce is to develop a points-based recognition system. Employees can then redeem their points for rewards that matter most to them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This type of recognition program allows you to maintain consistency by offering the same points to all employees, while still offering a </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/what-we-offer/rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">diverse selection of rewards</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> for each generation. Using employee surveys can help you better determine what types of rewards are ideal for each generation. The important thing is that a points-based system can provide a more personalized, more meaningful, and more effective rewards experience.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2>4. On-the-go recognition<span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With over </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">80 percent of the population</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> now owning a smartphone, mobile recognition is a must-have. A mobile platform gives your employees the power to send and receive recognition from anywhere. Your employees will be able to review recognition on-the-go, at home, or literally anywhere their phone is.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Employees will also be able to review their recognition activity at times that are most convenient for them. This is ideal for multigenerational workforces because it allows employees of all ages to use the program in a way that best meets their needs and fits their lifestyle.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2>5. Facebook, Snapchat, and more </h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to recent research, </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273476/percentage-of-us-population-with-a-social-network-profile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">79 percent of the U.S. population</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> uses some form of social media. Furthermore, </span><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-statistics-for-social-media-managers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">studies</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> show that 68 percent of Facebook and 63 percent of Snapchat users sign into the platform every day. Young adults are among the earliest social media adopters and continue to use these sites at high levels, while </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">usage by older adults has increased</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> in recent years. These facts make social media a great example of the type of user experience employees want. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When creating a recognition program for your multigenerational workforce, be sure to offer a fun user experience similar to social media platforms. Have a company-wide newsfeed that displays all recognitions in real-time and give employees the opportunity to like or comment on colleague&#8217;s recognitions. Also, give employees the option to add fun photos or gifs to the recognitions they send.</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">Lastly, don&#8217;t forget to encourage your employees to share their recognitions across their social media channels; this will help promote your company as a great place to work.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23489" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/02-11-20-2.jpg" alt="multigenerational workforce facebook social media" width="750" height="250" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/02-11-20-2.jpg 750w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/02-11-20-2-300x100.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h2>6. Incorporate company values </h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Employee recognition becomes most effective when companies make it an integral part of their company culture. The best way to create a culture of appreciation is to tie recognition into key company values. This step will not only help your workers identify company values, but it can actually help to modify key behaviors in the workforce. In fact, in a recent study, 88 percent of the employers surveyed believed that </span><a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/employee-recognition-and-values-.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">tying recognition to company</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> values helped them change behaviors in the workplace.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One idea to make this happen is to use a recognition platform that prompts employees to select a specific company value when giving a recognition. Employees are able to see exactly how their behaviors (and their colleagues&#8217; behaviors) tie back to the company&#8217;s values.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2>7. Celebrate special achievements </h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A great way to promote recognition across your multigenerational workforce is to celebrate special occasions, such as birthdays, work anniversaries, and major milestones (i.e., hitting sales goals). One way to celebrate special achievements is to send digital celebration cards that team members can sign and customize. Establishing parameters for specific types of recognition will ensure everyone, of all generations, receives recognition.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The most important step is to have a system in place, such as prompts within your recognition platform, that ensures you don’t miss any birthdays or work anniversaries throughout the year. This mistake could hav</span><span data-contrast="auto">e a negative effect instead of promoting engagement.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

For the last year, employees have operated in crisis mode as a result of the pandemic. Despite many employees demonstrating admirable flexibility and creativity amidst rapidly changing requirements, employee engagement has suffered, and employee commitment is not expected to last. In fact, employers may soon see a <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/turnover-tsunami-expected-once-pandemic-ends.aspx">turnover “tsunami”</a>—a mass exodus of employees quitting their jobs after the pandemic ends.</p>
<p>It’s clear that today’s employees expect more from their companies and their jobs. They want more opportunities to balance work and personal lives, work in organizations that see and value them, and recognize their contributions. Thankfully, numerous studies reinforce the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/why-employee-recognition-important-benefits/">positive impact employee recognition programs have</a> on employees, companies, and customers. It has even been found that when senior leaders are actively involved in employee recognition, companies are nine times more likely to have strong business results. Investing in employee recognition means that everybody wins.</p>
<p>Before digging in to define your recognition strategy, considering how to frame the plan for senior management will go a long way to secure buy-in and ensure adoption across the organization. Here are 5 stats to help get you started on building your business case:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A survey found that 69% of employees said recognition and rewards would <a href="http://www.achievers.com/resources/infographics-slideshares/new-year-new-job">motivate them to stay</a> with their company.</strong><br />
This finding came in ahead of more time off at 57% and the ability to work remotely at 55%.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Employees say the most powerful recognition <a href="http://www.gallup.com/workplace/236441/employee-recognition-low-cost-high-impact.aspx">comes from their direct manager</a> (28%).</strong><br />
This is followed by a high-level leader (24%), the manager’s manager (12%), a customer (10%), and peers (9%).</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Positive peer feedback can <a href="http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/motivate-employees-with-ongoing-forward-looking-feedback">enhance employee performance up to 14%</a>.</strong><br />
The same Gartner research shows that organizations that also ensure feedback is ongoing, not episodic, can drive performance by 12%.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Frequent recognition boosts retention – 63% of employees who were always or usually recognized said they are <a href="http://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-recognition/employee-recognition-and-retention-statistics">very unlikely to job hunt</a> in the next 3–6 months.</strong><br />
Companies can save millions in hiring and training costs by instilling a sense of purpose in their workplace, which ultimately helps to retain top talent.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Disengaged employees in the U.S. alone already cost organizations <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2013/09/23/surprising-disturbing-facts-from-the-mother-of-all-employee-engagement-surveys/?sh=6692fad43120">$450 to $550 billion a year</a>.</strong> <br />
Gallup estimates the figure is the combined cost of lost productivity, increased likelihood of workplace theft, negative influences on coworkers, missed workdays, and unsatisfactory customer interactions.</li>

Is it the perks? The location? Maybe the compensation?</p>
<p>Ultimately, the key to creating and sustaining a high-performing organization is establishing a healthy work environment. Businesses that prioritize long-term success must show that they care about their employees, whether their team members are on-site, remote, or part time. But it’s hard to define a healthy work environment, let alone put it into practice — particularly when so many employees are working from home. This piece delves into what a healthy work environment is and outlines seven steps to get there.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-culture-report/">Download Achievers’ free report on what a healthy work environment and culture look like in our new normal.</a></strong></p>
<h2>What does a healthy work environment look like?</h2>
<p>While some classify work environments into various categories — like creative, social, goal-oriented, and traditional — the best work environments feature the positive elements of all these types. A fantastic work environment celebrates innovation and individuality. It encourages collaboration and teamwork while providing employees with the flexibility and autonomy they need to reach their personal goals.</p>
<p>Healthy work environments are also safe, both psychologically and physically. Organizations with great cultures make it a point to support employee wellness and accept all backgrounds. Their leaders are transparent about why decisions are made, and they recognize employees who live out company values each day.</p>
<h2>7 ways to build a healthy work environment</h2>
<p>Creating and maintaining a healthy work environment requires a winning strategy. Here are seven best practices you can follow to start transforming your organization’s culture for the better.</p>
<h3>1. Give your employees a real voice</h3>
<p>Feedback is one of the most valuable gifts you can get from your employees. Providing opportunities for employees to express their feelings lets you identify ways you can help them excel.</p>
<p>But to create those opportunities for sharing feedback, you need the right technology. Tools like <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">AI-powered HR chatbots</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">pulse surveys</a> make it easy to transition from annual surveys — which don’t result in timely action — to an evolving conversation with employees in real time. This makes it easy to pinpoint and resolve your organization’s most pressing issues. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">Look for an employee engagement platform</a> that includes features like these to make building employee voice simple for HR, managers, and the C-suite.</p>
<p>However, soliciting feedback is only the first step. Failing to take action on survey results <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/241253/ways-botch-employee-surveys.aspx">leads to lower engagement</a> than failing to survey in the first place. To show employees that their voices actually matter — and keep them motivated to share what they really think — encourage managers to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">create action plans in response to feedback</a> collaboratively with their teams. Managers can host team sessions to review survey results, discuss areas for improvement, and develop next steps that everyone has a stake in.</p>
<h3>2. Show appreciation every day</h3>
<p>Think about the last time you got a shout out from your boss when you least expected it. It probably gave you a rush of confidence, instantly boosting your mood. Maybe it even gave you the energy you needed to close out a big project. Frequent, meaningful recognition can dramatically <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/why-employee-recognition-important-benefits/">improve employee engagement, retention, and satisfaction</a>. Not surprisingly, recognition is a key part of a healthy work environment.</p>
<p>Recognition is the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-culture-report/">number one ask</a> from employees in our new normal, and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">82% of employees</a> wish they received more recognition. Encourage recognition across your organization, from staff all the way to the C-suite. Recognition should be public so that employees echo and learn from others’ successes, and it should be specific enough to reinforce behaviors that you want employees to repeat.</p>
<p>The fastest way to make recognition a habit is to leverage recognition technology. Organizations without recognition technology are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">160% more likely</a> to recognize employees only twice a year or less. By <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-software/">selecting a modern recognition platform</a>, employees can say thanks — or dole out reward points — anytime, anywhere, without interrupting their established workflows.</p>
<p>3. Focus on the workplace itself — even if you&#8217;re remote!</p>
<p>Did you know that an attractive office design can make employees up to <a href="https://www.talent-works.com/2018/08/workplace-stats-infographic/">33% happier</a>? An employee’s workspace can <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/how-to-design-a-workspace-that-boosts-employee-motivation/">keep them motivated, improve their well-being, and promote healthy habits</a>. Invest in making your office a more enjoyable place to be, and your employees will love spending time there.</p>
<p>Even if most of your workforce is remote, where they work still affects their performance. Make sure your employees have a comfortable, stimulating place to work outside the office by providing a stipend for things like ergonomic chairs, extra monitors, and standing desks. Ask employees to speak up when they need a new mouse, keyboard, or other office supplies. And remind employees that keeping their desks decluttered, getting enough sunlight, and adding inspiring artwork to their workspace can maximize their productivity and boost their mood.</p>
<h3>4. Turn your values into more than just words</h3>
<p>No employee wants to work at an organization that lacks compelling values, or one that doesn’t practice what it preaches. Developing and living by meaningful core values drives a great organizational culture and, eventually, profits. Organizations with highly aligned cultures, together with highly aligned innovation strategies, see <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/business-case-culture-alignment/">30% higher enterprise value growth and 17% higher profit growth</a>. Not only that, compelling values attract better candidates. <a href="https://www.ihire.com/blog/core-values-2020-survey-results">Over 75% of employees</a> consider it very important to work for a company with defined core values.</p>
<p>Employees look to leadership to establish standards for conducting business, internally and externally. Company values should <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/company-core-value-examples/">reflect the underlying philosophy of a business</a>, and they should be easy for all employees to understand and remember. You should also reward and recognize employees who exemplify your company’s core values, which <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">encourages other team members to follow suit</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/how-to-maintain-culture-continuity-during-covid-19/">Discover how to maintain a consistent culture and values in our new normal.</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>5. Create an environment of psychological safety and trust</h3>
<p>An <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/psychological-safety-at-work/">environment of psychological safety</a> is one where employees are comfortable being themselves. They know they can express themselves freely without the fear of embarrassment or retaliation. When employees are confident their ideas won’t be rejected out of hand or scoffed at, they’re far more likely to participate in meaningful conversations, voice their opinions, and stay engaged.</p>
<p>Establishing a workplace that takes psychological safety seriously requires practice and dedication, but it’s worth it. Employees at high-trust companies report <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-neuroscience-of-trust">74% less stress</a>, exhibit 50% higher productivity, and experience 40% less burnout.</p>
<p>Psychological safety is <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/try-strengthening-team-engagement-with-psychological-safety/">built on a foundation of genuine care for the employee</a>. Regularly check in on employees’ mental, physical, and emotional health, and give them the time off they need. Most importantly, teach managers to adopt practices that promote psychological safety. Workshops can be a great way for managers to practice leading with empathy, giving specific recognition, and phasing out micromanagement. Managers need to listen more than they speak and should invite open and honest conversations between them and their teams. Besides nurturing trust, this sets an example for team members at your organization who may find themselves in a leadership role one day.</p>
<h3>6. Prioritize cultural alignment when hiring</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/organizational-culture-definition/">Organizational culture is a shared experience</a>, felt throughout a company and developed over time. As you might imagine, the people your organization hires play a huge role in sustaining its culture. <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/the-leaders-guide-to-corporate-culture">Harvard Business Review found</a> that when properly aligned with personal values, drives, and needs, “culture can unleash tremendous amounts of energy toward a shared purpose and foster an organization’s capacity to thrive.” Aligning your workforce with your culture should be central to your strategy for beating the competition.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/culture-alignment-techniques-that-drive-business-performance/"><strong>Download Achievers’ free report on the culture alignment techniques that drive business performance.</strong></a></em></p>
<p>During the recruitment process, it’s crucial to vet candidates carefully to ensure they match the energy of your company and are passionate about its mission. Ask questions about the culture they experienced at previous companies and what they liked or didn’t like. Find out what research they’ve done on your organization’s culture and what positive qualities they bring.</p>
<p>And don’t forget it also goes both ways. The culture of an organization is apparent from the moment a candidate speaks to any employee. Since potential hires can pick up on cultural dysfunction during the interview process, the team members they meet should strive to exemplify your organization’s best cultural traits.</p>
<h3>7. Empower your team with what they need to succeed</h3>
<p>No matter how capable your workforce is, they need support to be their best selves at work. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-empowerment/">Empowering employees</a> can take many forms, from extra learning and development, to greater flexibility in working hours, to autonomy over new projects. Employee empowerment requires managers, HR, and the C-suite to act in tandem to provide employees with whatever it takes to build success.</p>
<p>Of course, knowing exactly what your team needs to succeed requires a strong culture of feedback. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/empowerment-and-trust-the-keys-to-employee-engagement/">one in seven organizations lack a formal mechanism</a> for listening to their employees. And while 64% of employees want an always-on feedback tool, only 22% of HR leaders say their organization is effective or very effective at fostering a culture of feedback.</p>
<p>Establish open feedback channels using tools like pulse surveys and HR chatbots, and then give employees what they ask for. This demonstrates that your organization is truly listening and encourages team members to keep voicing their wants and needs.</p>
<h2>Start improving your work environment today</h2>
<p>A healthy work environment is one where employees feel heard, they’re acknowledged for their contributions, and they understand how their work is part of something bigger. This leads to more innovation, greater trust in leadership, and an improved bottom line — organizations with highly engaged workers are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/241649/employee-engagement-rise.aspx">21% more profitable</a>.</p>
<p>HR technology can help you reap the rewards of a healthy work environment. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/">Achievers Recognize</a> is an award-winning recognition platform that makes it easy for your entire team to start showing appreciation, whether they’re in-office or remote.

<p>And if you’re interested in supporting employee voice, look no further than <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/listen/">Achievers Listen</a>. Achievers Listen is an always-on engagement platform that captures employee voice through easy-to-use pulse surveys and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">Allie, an AI-powered, always-on feedback channel</a>.

But these interactions can be difficult to navigate, if you can even find the time to initiate them. Considering how to accept praise gracefully, whether you should return the compliment, the best way to avoid miscommunication — the recognition process can be anything but simple.</p>
<p>Making the compliment experience a positive one can have a huge impact on your performance, and that of your organization. Take a look at these example compliments, tips on how to respond to them, and some best practices for providing recognition of your own.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">Download Achievers’ free report on the business impact of inclusive and frequent recognition.</a></strong></em></p>
<h2>Responding to compliments at work</h2>
<p>Compliments can come up at almost any time — during a meeting, after a chance encounter in the hall, or even when working remotely! But there are some basic principles that will let you handle compliments no matter when you receive them.</p>
<p>First, keep in mind what compliments mean. Maybe you don’t believe that you aced your last presentation, or that you’ve been providing exceptional customer service lately. But quibbling with a compliment isn’t productive, and in fact, it reflects a basic misunderstanding. The importance of a compliment isn’t tied up with its content, but with its intent. The person recognizing you is trying to show you how much they appreciate you. Tell them thanks, and let them know you appreciate their compliment in return.</p>
<p>This may not be easy, but if you practice it consistently, it will become natural in no time. Here are some ways to effectively respond to compliments in a variety of circumstances.</p>
<h3>Recognition from a peer</h3>
<p><em>“Thank you for the kind words. It means a lot to me.”</em><br />
<em>“I really appreciate you reaching out to me. Thanks so much.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/peer-to-peer-recognition/">Peer recognition</a> can mean just as much — or more — than compliments from managers or other leaders. It’s the foundation on which a culture of recognition is built, and it can <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/motivate-employees-with-ongoing-forward-looking-feedback/">enhance employee performance by up to 14 percent</a>.</p>
<p>When you receive praise from a coworker, they might be acknowledging your skills, achievements, or just your personality! However they’re showing that they appreciate you, each compliment is another chance to strengthen the bonds between team members. Making connections with your peers makes your job easier and much more pleasant, so seek to pass the recognition on by complimenting coworkers in turn.</p>
<h3>A compliment from a leader</h3>
<p><em>“Hearing that from you is amazing. Thank you.”</em><br />
<em>“Thanks, I’m thrilled you like the project! I was happy with how it turned out too.”</em></p>
<p>While a compliment from a peer is always welcome, there’s something special about receiving recognition from a leader, whether it’s your manager or even one of your organization’s executives. The best leaders serve as examples for all team members, and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/why-leaders-need-to-be-recognition-champions/">showing appreciation is no exception</a>.</p>
<p>Appreciation from leadership might be particularly impactful, but that doesn’t mean you should respond to leaders’ compliments any differently. Don’t shrink from their praise because of their position. Instead, focus on the intent behind their praise, express appreciation for the compliment, and keep the cycle of recognition going by providing further compliments yourself, whether as part of your response or later on.</p>
<p>Thanks for a group project</p>
<p><em>“Thank you so much. It was a team win! I’ll be sure to pass on your praise during our next meeting.”</em><br />
<em>“Wow, thanks! I’ll email the team right away — they’ll be so happy to hear their hard work paid off.”</em></p>
<p>Many of your tasks aren’t solo efforts. Whether you’re part of a formal working group or simply standing on the shoulders of giants, your achievements are often a team effort. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/building-a-team-of-true-team-players/">And that’s a great thing</a>!</p>
<p>Your first priority when receiving a compliment for a group project should be to include your team members, both in your response and by sharing the compliment with them afterwards. But this doesn’t mean you should deflect the recognition or minimize your contributions. After all, you were a part of the winning effort, and you deserve appreciation as much as your coworkers.</p>
<h3>Remote compliments</h3>
<p><em>“I’m really glad you liked the presentation! Thank you. Maybe we can have a virtual coffee chat to catch up and celebrate.”</em><br />
<em>“Thanks for that! Let’s schedule a video chat with the whole team so you can share your praise with everyone who contributed.”</em></p>
<p>Remote work comes with many benefits — flexibility in work arrangements, reduced overhead, and the ability to hire talent from anywhere. But it can also make staying connected to your organization and team more difficult, especially when it comes to providing recognition. After all, you can’t say thanks in the hallway or break room when they don’t exist!</p>
<p>Overcoming the challenges of receiving and providing compliments while working remotely is more than worth it. A<a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-software/">dopt an employee recognition platform</a> designed with a mobile-first philosophy to let employees incorporate appreciation into their everyday routines, no matter where they are or what they’re doing.</p>
<p>When you get a compliment while working remotely, it may be through a recognition platform or by email, chat, or video call. Regardless of how you were recognized, you can accept it with mindfulness and appreciation, just as you would if you were thanked in person. Use an appropriate channel to respond to the recognition, letting the recipient know that you’re grateful for their praise. And if your organization has embraced employee recognition software, then you can use it to easily pass the recognition on by showing gratitude to the team member who thanked you or another coworker.</p>
<h2>Giving compliments at work: keep the cycle of recognition going</h2>
<p>Receiving compliments is a key part of building a culture of recognition, but providing recognition in turn is just as important. To make recognition as impactful as possible and turn it into a core part of your organizational culture, follow the principles of R.I.S.E:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-28627" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/RISE-300x166.png" alt="" width="525" height="258" /></p>
<p>
These principles are effective at an individual and organizational level. You should show recognition frequently, for both major wins and everyday successes, rather than reserving kudos for only the biggest victories. And if you provide appreciation quickly after the specific behavior you’re recognizing — and clearly link it to that behavior — the recipient is <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">more likely to take that action again in the future</a>. Follow these best practices and you’ll see that a small seed of recognition can grow quickly, improving morale, engagement, and performance across your organization.</p>
<h2>Build a culture of recognition with Achievers</h2>
<p>Giving and responding to compliments can be an everyday occurrence at your organization, with the right technology. A reward and recognition (R&amp;R) platform that promotes engagement with each recognition and lets employees show appreciation from anywhere can transform your workplace.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/">Achievers Recognize</a> lets your team members provide both social and monetary recognition — the latter in the form of points that employees can redeem for rewards that they actually want. And because it integrates with the tools your organization uses on a daily basis, from Outlook to Zoom, recognition will become a seamless part of the employee experience.</p>

Remote work isn’t just a trend, it’s the new reality.</p>
<p>Remote work can lead to improved productivity, but it also comes with unique challenges that organizations need to address to stay at the top of their game. It’s easy to let communication, recognition, effective onboarding, and professional development slip. Managers default to micromanagement, causing distrust among their employees.</p>
<p>The good news is that businesses can overcome these challenges with proven tactics that help remote employees collaborate and stay engaged.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/workforce-webinar-employee-engagement-and-working-remotely/"><em><strong>Explore the connection between employee engagement and working remotely in this free webinar.</strong></em></a></p>
<h2>11 ways to engage remote employees</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/remote-work/">Remote work</a> is here to stay. Finding ways to raise morale, respond to changes nimbly, and foster engagement is the key to maintaining a winning culture with a remote workforce. Follow these 11 strategies to keep your employees motivated, productive, and connected.</p>
<h3>1. Give your remote employees a real voice in your organization</h3>
<p>Remote employees <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">want their voices heard</a>, no matter where they are. Employees who are able to express what they truly feel — and then see the organization take action on that feedback — are motivated to contribute as much as they can to their company’s success. Salesforce Research found that when an employee feels heard, that person is <a href="https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/employees-who-feel-heard-are-46x-more-likely-to-feel-empowered-to-do-their-best-work.html">4.6 times more likely to feel empowered</a> to perform to the best of their abilities.</p>
<p>Give your remote workforce opportunities to exercise their voice with recurring employee engagement surveys. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">Pulse surveys</a> can help gauge reception to particular topics over time, while <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">always-on feedback channels</a> enable employees to give feedback about anything in real-time. Implementing both strategies gives you a holistic picture of how your workforce is feeling. And with an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">employee engagement platform</a>, all the data you collect is easy for managers to review, analyze, and act on.</p>
<p>HR plays an important role in helping managers act on feedback from remote employees. They encourage and teach managers how to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">develop collaborative action plans</a> together with their employees. When managers receive survey results, they should host listening sessions where team members can provide input and share how they would respond to surfaced issues. This listening session should be a safe space where employees feel comfortable sharing honest thoughts on problems and the steps required to address them. This joint effort establishes trust among managers and their direct reports, and helps both parties feel invested in putting the action plan into practice.</p>
<h3>2. Show remote employees they’re appreciated</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition/">Practicing employee recognition</a> is a critical part of engaging remote workers. Professionals often suffer from imposter syndrome, and working remotely can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy. Showing appreciation frequently is the key to a confident, high-performing workforce.</p>
<p>Both social and monetary recognition are effective ways to combat negative feelings. In fact, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/social-recognition-what-why-and-how/">social recognition</a> may be even more effective than monetary recognition at boosting engagement and retention rates. Social recognition can lead to a <a href="https://web.boardroominsiders.com/blog/the-inside-track-4-defining-chro-priorities-during-covid-19">55% increase in engagement</a>. And it plays a heavy role in reducing turnover. After all, who would want to leave an organization that actually recognizes your achievements? Social recognition even has the potential to dramatically <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/">strengthen NPS scores, overall employee performance, and even stock prices</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/">Download Achievers’ free guide to building a business case for social recognition</a></strong></em></p>
<p>When it comes to monetary recognition, points-based reward systems let your remote workforce choose rewards that actually matter to them. As employees’ points balances rise, they become more inspired and motivated to perform their best. To encourage adoption, let employees “boost” their peers’ recognitions, awarding the recipient extra points.</p>
<p>How can you enable these best practices? <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-software/">Adopt an employee recognition platform</a> that’s easy for remote employees to incorporate into their daily workflows. That means it needs an intuitive user interface, a mobile-first design philosophy, and support for points-based rewards. It should also integrate with your engagement platform and communication tools like <a href="https://www.achievers.com/connect/teams/">Microsoft Teams</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/connect/slack/">Slack</a> so it fits seamlessly into employees’ routines.</p>
<h3>3. Keep remote employees connected with tools for communication and collaboration</h3>
<p>Working remotely can make employees feel lonely and disconnected. To prevent this, establish a framework for frequent, structured communication between peers and among managers and their direct reports. Regular scheduled check-ins promote social interaction and help teams stay aligned. Don’t go overboard, though. It’s easy to disrupt someone’s workflow with an ad hoc call or fall into the micromanagement trap.</p>
<p>Once you’ve settled on a good meeting cadence, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/achievers-remote-workplace/">explore tools to facilitate better communication and teamwork</a>. Video call platforms like Google Meet and Zoom can make your virtual work environment more collaborative, as can chat tools like Slack and Google Chat. Platforms like these make it easy to keep remote employees involved in company decisions and discussions and provide them with as much responsibility as in-office employees. Project management software is also a good investment, as it increases visibility and makes working together easier. Overall, pick tools that are easy to use 一 steep learning curves will discourage your remote employees from using new technology.</p>
<h3>4. Don’t let professional development fall on the backburner</h3>
<p>It’s easy for things to slip when switching to remote work, but professional development shouldn’t be one of them. Supporting continuous learning and development is a win-win. Employees gain invaluable skills while employers grow, develop, and retain top talent.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/"><em>Download Achievers Workforce Institute’s 2021 Engagement and Retention Report.</em></a></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/5-ways-to-engage-employees-through-learning-and-development/">Investing in a learning management system</a> (LMS) that’s accessible from anywhere is a good start. LMS software enables HR teams to purchase and upload training courses on various topics, from writing elegant code, to perfecting PowerPoint skills, to effective leadership practices. Veteran employees and managers can also <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/managers-as-coaches/">coach their less experienced counterparts</a> to unlock their potential and keep them connected. And covering the cost of further training or formal education is just as welcome whether your employees are in-office or across the country.</p>
<h3>5. Create remote work policies</h3>
<p>The freedom to work how and where you want can be both exciting and overwhelming. To keep remote workers on track, craft remote work policies that set expectations and add structure to employees’ days. These policies give workers a tangible connection to your organization and shows them that they have the same privileges and responsibilities as any other employee.</p>
<p>Your policies should address things like remote communication guidelines, what times everyone should be online and available for group meetings, and how managers should interact with their direct reports. In addition, consider what kind of behavior you expect when employees meet with customers virtually. You can also use this as an opportunity to reinforce your confidentiality and data protection policies when sharing information with clients.</p>
<h3>6. Have HR train managers and employees on remote work skills</h3>
<p>Many managers haven’t supervised workers remotely before. They’re likely to struggle to stay afloat themselves, let alone lead their teams. Harvard Business Review found that 40% of supervisors and managers <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/07/remote-managers-are-having-trust-issues">expressed low self-confidence in their ability to manage workers remotely</a>. In particular, managers lacked confidence in coordinating a remote team and in persuading remote workers to do their job well. This uncertainty makes employees feel distrusted and micromanaged.</p>
<p>HR should conduct training on how to best handle remote work to make everyone more comfortable and engaged. Besides providing moral support, ensure workers have proper equipment and resources. Offer productivity tips and explain the benefits of remote work done well. Have managers <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/how-to-build-trust-and-community-while-working-remotely/">ask pertinent questions about what’s working and what isn’t</a> during brief scheduled check-ins with their remote team. And don’t forget about the C-suite! Your executives should lead the way when it comes to these best practices.</p>
<h3>7. Engage remote employees with games and activities</h3>
<p>It’s easy to walk over to someone’s desk and suggest an impromptu lunch when you’re in-office. And you can enable these spontaneous interactions virtually as well. Have team members brew cups of coffee, join a video call, and ask them about their day. Casual coffee chats are a nice break from the fast pace of work.</p>
<p>If your team needs to wind down even more, create a standing happy hour each week or organize movie nights. You might even play online multiplayer games together or treat everyone to a virtual lunch with icebreakers. Gathering everyone for team events helps create a sense of community that otherwise might be lacking in a remote workplace.</p>
<h3>8. Support mental wellness</h3>
<p>Working from home comes with mental wellness risk factors that many employers overlook. According to McKinsey, workplace stress drives voluntary turnover and adversely affects productivity. Micromanagement and low autonomy can <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/mental-health-problems-in-the-workplace">exacerbate mental health issues</a> like depression, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and anxiety. Workplace stress is so harmful that it costs U.S. employers almost <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-overlooked-essentials-of-employee-well-being">$200 billion every year</a>.</p>
<p>Promoting mental, physical, and emotional wellness helps <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/burnout-job/">fight burnout</a> and keep your remote employees happy. One of the best ways to avoid burnout is to take time off from work. Make sure to emphasize to your employees that taking time away from work to recharge is both normal and acceptable.</p>
<p>To reduce everyday burnout, promote other healthy habits like getting enough sleep and eating nourishing foods. Give your remote employees ideas like changing where or how they work, picking up new hobbies to tap into their creativity, and seeking support from peers or friends when needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/4-tips-cultivate-mindfulness-work/">Mindfulness and self-awareness</a> can also help employees engage with their own emotions and act thoughtfully even in the most difficult situations. With dedication and practice, these serve as useful coping mechanisms and help employees develop strong concentration skills. To encourage this behavior, hire a mindfulness expert to put on a workshop or give employees a free subscription to a meditation app.</p>
<p>You could even start a “healthy habit challenge” to motivate your employees to take care of themselves. Try <a href="https://www.achievers.com/press/achievers-launches-integration-with-wellright-to-streamline-employee-rewards-recognition-and-wellness/">integrating your recognition software with wellness platforms</a> so that employees can receive reward points when they meditate, drink enough water, spend quality time with family, or get exercise. At the end of the month, team members can redeem their points for prizes in your rewards marketplace. These programs incentivize employees to stay healthy so that they can be their best selves at work.</p>
<h3>9. Celebrate milestones virtually</h3>
<p>Working virtually doesn’t mean that you can’t honor big wins. Continue to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/how-to-make-remote-employees-feel-included/">celebrate important milestones</a> to maintain high morale and prevent disengagement. For instance, you can publicly recognize people on your intranet for work anniversaries and birthdays. Others can then comment and add to what’s been written and might be reminded to congratulate another coworker on an achievement, keeping the cycle of recognition going.</p>
<p>If you use a points-based recognition program, encourage managers to set an example by sending points to people who complete a professional course, deliver an outstanding presentation, or go above-and-beyond in some way. Encourage <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/peer-to-peer-recognition/">peer-to-peer recognition</a> as well by prompting employees to recognize others who helped them take a sale over the finish line or complete a significant project. You can even award a virtual team lunch for teams who exemplify your company’s values each month. These celebrations all look a little different, but taking the time to personalize them and make employees feel special keeps everyone inspired.</p>
<h3>10. Be flexible about when and where remote employees work</h3>
<p>Lean into the innate flexibility of remote work to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-empowerment/">empower your employees</a>. Some people naturally work better at home without distractions in the office. Others may prefer working in a new setting like a coffee shop, coworking space, or a library. A work-from-anywhere policy means employees can relocate to areas with a lower cost of living or to somewhere closer to their family. Giving your employees the freedom to choose where they work can boost morale and creativity.</p>
<p>Allowing your employees to set their own hours — to some degree — can also alleviate stress and help them work more efficiently. Some of your employees might be taking care of small children or other family members at home, making it difficult to structure their schedule. And every employee will enjoy the flexibility to take an hour out of their day to walk their dog, go for a run, or even just do a load of laundry. Getting these things done helps employees feel accomplished on a personal level, and they’ll take that motivation back to their work lives.</p>
<p>That said, there are times where teamwork is necessary. Talk to leadership about setting aside certain time frames for discussing projects as a team and allowing employees to flex some of their hours outside of these periods. Even offering limited flexible work hours shows employees that you care about them and entices them to stay with your organization longer.</p>
<h3>11. Make remote onboarding an unforgettable experience</h3>
<p>Organizations work hard to provide a memorable in-person onboarding experience, and remote onboarding shouldn’t be any different. Making newcomers feel at home and connected in a virtual environment is key to retaining them over time.</p>
<p>Normally, new hires would spend the first few days meeting everyone on their team and other folks in the office. Consider hosting get-to-know-you video calls where new and existing employees formally introduce themselves. Make a list of icebreaker questions to make the conversation lively and help coworkers get to know each other more quickly. And take the time to showcase your recognition and rewards program, professional development benefits, and other perks of working at your organization. A highly interactive onboarding experience will encourage new hires to continue participating in company events in the future.</p>

But what does engagement really mean? And how important is it?</p>
<p>You don’t have to look far to find out that employee engagement is critical to your company’s success. Highly engaged employers experience a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/6-mind-blowing-stats-employee-engagement/">25 to 59% decrease in turnover</a> and 41% lower absentee rates.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/"><em><strong>Download Achievers Workforce Institute’s 2021 Engagement and Retention Report.</strong></em></a></p>
<p>However, o<a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/">nly 21% of employees</a> consider themselves “very engaged” at work. This disengagement is costly. In the U.S. alone, disengagement costs up to <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/study-disengaged-employees-can-cost-companies-up-to-550b-a-year/437606/">$550 billion per year</a>.</p>
<p>Read on to get a handle on employee engagement and discover nine key statistics that demonstrate the far-reaching benefits of an engaged workforce and the startling cons of disengagement.</p>
<h2>What is employee engagement?</h2>
<p>Employee engagement is a measure of the enthusiasm, emotional connection, and dedication workers have to their organization and its mission. People often confuse employee engagement with employee satisfaction, but engagement is centered around motivation and purpose, not just happiness.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-strategies/">promote employee engagement</a>, employers should focus on key drivers of a supportive culture, like increased recognition and frequently soliciting and acting on feedback. Employers should listen to their employees and offer the necessary resources for employees to grow in their careers and develop into future leaders.</p>
<h2>9 employee engagement statistics you need to know</h2>
<p>Here are nine statistics that emphasize how vital employee engagement truly is and how it can make a difference in your workplace.</p>
<h3>1. Organizations with highly-rated cultures of recognition are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">2.5 times more likely to see improved employee engagement</a>.</h3>
<p>Establishing a culture of recognition is a tough, but necessary, part of employee engagement. Many managers and employees aren’t sure how to show appreciation effectively. The best recognition is specific, frequent, and genuine. Recognition needs to occur between employees at every level, from staff to the C-suite. Consistent, reciprocal recognition instills trust between employees and their managers and peers 一 a core tenet of employee engagement.</p>
<p>Recognition also reinforces behaviors that line up with an organization’s goals and demonstrate care for employees’ well-being. Indeed, 90% of workers say receiving recognition <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">motivates them to work harder</a>. And recognition doesn’t just improve morale and productivity, it affects your organization’s bottom line. Employers that practice social recognition are f<a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/">our times more likely to see improved stock prices</a>.</p>
<h3>2. 64% of HR leaders say an always-on feedback tool is essential to an engagement listening program, but <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/empowerment-and-trust-the-keys-to-employee-engagement/">only 20% have this kind of tool in place</a>.</h3>
<p>Employees want to give feedback, but they’ll become disengaged if you don’t act on their input quickly. Although <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/empowerment-and-trust-the-keys-to-employee-engagement/">nearly 40% of organizations still use them</a>, annual surveys aren’t the answer. By the time results are compiled, acting on them is too late.</p>
<p>If you want to show employees that their voices matter, use always-on feedback tools like <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/videos/engagement-how-ai-helps-hr-to-be-more-human-not-less-webinar/">AI-powered HR chatbots</a>. These tools are available to accept input 24/7, and they encourage employees to give further details regarding their feedback without interfering with everyday work. Employees can engage with bots at any point in time, rather than waiting to share their thoughts once a year. On the back end, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">AI chatbots learn what employees need and suggest best practices</a> for managers to take appropriate action.</p>
<h3>3. 58% of employees <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/pulse-surveys-employee-engagement/">wish their company conducted employee engagement surveys more frequently</a>.</h3>
<p>Although there is a clear connection between the frequency of surveys and engagement, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/pulse-surveys-employee-engagement/">only 21% of companies</a> conduct engagement surveys three or more times a year. The workplace is constantly changing. To keep engagement high during periods of intense growth or unforeseen circumstances, leadership teams need to find ways to check in with their employees more often.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to leverage <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">pulse surveys</a> 一 quick surveys sent weekly or monthly to get a “pulse” on how employees are feeling. Pulse surveys can ask questions concerning job function, professional development, relationships, and other key aspects of engagement.</p>
<p>While the answers might not always be pretty, pulse surveys work. Managers can use pulse surveys to keep a real-time check on engagement and then <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">collaboratively come up with an action plan</a> to address any issues with their team. And pulse survey results are a great opportunity for HR and upper management to identify and address problems facing the organization as a whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/pulse-surveys-employee-engagement/"><em><strong>Discover four ways pulse surveys can positively impact employee engagement.</strong></em></a></p>
<p>4. 71% of executives say that <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-impact-of-employee-engagement-on-performance-by-harvard-business-review-analytic-services/">employee engagement is an important contributor to organizational success.</a></p>
<p>It’s hard to think of reasons why companies shouldn’t concentrate on employee engagement. But if you needed any further convincing, one Harvard Business Review report found that a highly engaged workforce <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-impact-of-employee-engagement-on-performance-by-harvard-business-review-analytic-services/">maximizes a company’s investment in human capital</a>, while simultaneously reducing costs associated with things like turnover.</p>
<p>Investing in employee engagement means giving people the training they need to excel. It means encouraging them to pursue their passions, speak up about problems with company culture, and recognize the success of themselves and others. Financing employee engagement initiatives shapes employees into the workers you need to drive organizational success.</p>
<h3>5. Alignment with an organization’s values is the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-culture-report/">#1 predictor of employee engagement</a>.</h3>
<p>The purpose of a mission statement is to guide a company’s decision-making. When companies plan for the future, they reference their core values to ensure the direction they’re going matches what their employees believe in. Everyone has personal values, so it’s key to find out if these are compatible with your organization’s. Employees whose personal values are very well-aligned with their company’s values are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-culture-report/">five times more likely to report being engaged</a>. Not only that, aligned organizations are six times more profitable than those that aren’t.</p>
<p>There are many ways you can build alignment at your company. Before interviewing candidates, list out qualities that might be good indicators of harmony between an applicant’s values and those of the organization. Make sure managers can <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/how-to-approach-engagement-to-actually-make-a-difference/">connect each employee’s work to their intrinsic motivations</a> in addition to company values. Offer professional development that’s in line with the goals your company hopes to achieve. And be sure to communicate with employees often, particularly during this time of increased remote work. The employee engagement landscape is changing, but the more aligned your workforce is to your company values and culture, the better off it will be.</p>

<p>6. Managers are responsible for <a href="https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/182792/managers-account-variance-employee-engagement.aspx">70% of the variance in employee engagement</a>.</p>
<p>Do you trust your employer? Gallup found that just <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/258197/why-leaders-employees-trust-don.aspx">one in three employees</a> in Gallup&#8217;s global database strongly agree that they trust the leadership of their organization. But it’s not just the bigwigs that matter. Every manager is responsible for treating their direct reports with respect and driving employee engagement. Managers <a href="https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/182792/managers-account-variance-employee-engagement.aspx">play an enormous role in the employee experience</a>, so spending time and effort on manager training is worth it. Make sure managers <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/manager-effectiveness/">know how to acknowledge the work of their employees</a>, inspire them, and encourage them to develop the skills they need to shine.</p>
<p>7. 70% of employees state that being empowered to succeed is a <a href="https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/employee-relations/Pages/2016-Job-Satisfaction-and-Engagement-Survey.aspx">critical part of employee engagement</a>.</p>
<p>No one enjoys being micromanaged. It’s demeaning and suggests that your manager doesn’t think you have the capacity to keep track of your work and get tasks done on time. Unfortunately, many managers are afraid to hand over the reins, giving their employees small, monotonous tasks while taking on too much work themselves. This leaves employees bored and disengaged, and it risks burning out your managers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-empowerment/">Empower employees</a> to own projects themselves, utilize their skills cross-departmentally, and brainstorm new ways to approach problems. Implement job rotations and encourage employees to include stretch goals in their yearly targets. Give employees the autonomy to decide how to achieve their objectives. When employees grow and thrive, take the time to recognize their successes.</p>
<p>8. Disengaged workers <a href="http://www.ehstoday.com/safety/how-engaged-workers-are-safe-employees">make errors at a 60% higher rate</a>.</p>
<p>Employees go to work expecting that they’ll come home safely at the end of the day, but sadly, this isn’t always the case. No matter how many safety procedures you put into practice, there is still the potential for human error.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, disengaged employees are more likely to make mistakes that impact other employees’ safety. Employees who don’t care about their performance or an organization’s policies are less likely to follow them, hindering an organization’s growth and jeopardizing employee safety. Beyond physical injuries, disengagement can affect privacy and security as well. If employees fail to follow basic online security protocols, your company could lose millions of dollars in a devastating breach. On the flip side, teams that are considered engaged experience <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-true-cost-of-employee-disengagement/">48% fewer work-related injuries, saving companies $47,988</a> per worker’s compensation claim.</p>
<p>Involve employees in your safety program. Ask them to contribute ideas for improving existing policies to help more people stick to the rules. Host safety meetings and conduct ongoing training to educate and involve employees as much as possible. When changes happen, let employees know far in advance and teach them how to follow new protocols.</p>
<p>9. Engaged employees are <a href="https://www.inc.com/elizabeth-kiehner/whats-forgotten-in-cultures-and-your-companys-obsession-with-technology.html#:~:text=A%20survey%20of%20over%2050%2C000,those%20who%20are%20not%20engaged.">87% less likely to leave their organization</a>.</p>
<p>Retention is a huge problem for enterprises today — in fact, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kaytiezimmerman/2018/11/11/heres-why-employees-are-quitting-more-than-ever-before/">30% of job seekers have left a job within just 90 days of starting</a>. People don’t come to work solely because of their paycheck. Eighty-nine percent of employers think that their employees leave for more money, but the reality is that only <a href="https://officevibe.com/blog/disengaged-employees-infographic">12% of employees do</a>. Employees want to make an impact, interact with employees who inspire them, and feel recognized and rewarded for their hard work. So take a moment to evaluate the ways you might increase the chances of your employees staying.</p>
<p>Are they working too hard towards impossible deadlines? Do they have too little work? Encourage managers to ask these questions in their one-on-ones and follow up with pulse surveys to get more information. Ensure managers are clear about each employee’s role and expectations as well. If employees’ work-life balance isn’t where it needs to be, incorporate more flexibility into employees’ schedules or add more wellness perks to their benefits package. Try adding more socialization and team activities so employees can get to know each other better. And lastly, perfect your onboarding experience so that new employees feel comfortable and are set up for success.</p>
<h2>Start building employee engagement with the right tools</h2>

The report broke this figure down into the following categories: Outside training products and services accounted for $7.5 billion, while other expenditures such as travel, equipment, and facilities represented $44 billion, and payroll for in-house educators accounted for $41.6 billion. If you&#8217;re going to spend a pile of money on your employee training and development, how do you get the biggest ROI? Below are a few key directions to guide your strategy on this topic.</p>
<h2>Training and development shouldn’t be limited to job skills</h2>
<p>Of course, you want your employees to be as expert as possible at their job tasks, but that&#8217;s not the only purpose of training and development. To create a unified company culture, you have to reinforce the staff&#8217;s awareness of your organization&#8217;s core values. Failure to communicate the big picture can result in a kind of short-sightedness where your workers just feel like small, unimportant cogs in an impersonal machine. Whether it&#8217;s from a &#8220;<a href="https://trainingmag.com/content/cultivating-culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Start</a>&#8221; training for new hires that outlines the company&#8217;s history and mission or from an ongoing development approach, your development program must be aimed at integrating workers into the overall values of the company. <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/toolkits/pages/understandinganddevelopingorganizationalculture.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)</a> underlines this point: They say that HR departments should develop training programs that &#8220;outline and reinforce the organization&#8217;s core values and makes sure that appropriate rewards and recognition go to employees who truly embody the values.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Check outside reference points</h2>
<p>&#8220;Before agreeing to support a new initiative, company <a href="https://achievers.com/blog/words-inspiration-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaders</a> always want to know what the competition is doing and whether you&#8217;re doing more or less.&#8221; That <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/key-steps-for-better-training-development-programs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">useful advice from SHRM</a> provides a beginning point for HR professionals looking to upgrade their company&#8217;s training programs. SHRM is a great networking tool for this purpose because it allows you to keep in touch with your colleagues and learn what training resources have worked best for them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also useful to keep in mind that your company will be judged on the basis of how well it provides a career path for employees. Deloitte&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2016/04/11/the-learning-curve-is-the-earning-curve/#8c20ad637d09" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Bersin</a> urges companies to keep track of their ratings on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glassdoor</a> because its statistics show that employees place twice as much emphasis on career opportunities as they do on compensation. Bersin notes, &#8220;our employment brand and ability to attract and engage people is now directly related to learning.&#8221; Keep that goal of employee engagement in your mind; we&#8217;ll come back to it again.</p>
<h2>Plan for obsolescence</h2>
<p>In this era of rapid technological evolution, training your employees is not a one-and-done event. You need to look at ways to improve <a href="https://www.talentlms.com/blog/six-ways-improve-ongoing-training-for-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing training</a> and development for employees. Even if your company isn&#8217;t in the midst of changing any internal processes, your workers are constantly adapting to updated expectations from customers and company partners. In response to this shifting environment, training is most effective when it&#8217;s integrated into an ongoing program, rather than being confined within certain limited dates.</p>
<h2>Ask your team what they want</h2>
<p>Sounds obvious, right? While you undoubtedly have your own agenda of what your staff needs to learn, you should include them in the final training and development decisions. After all, they&#8217;re the ones who have to put their learning into action, so they have a strong vested interest in it. When SHRM held <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/key-steps-for-better-training-development-programs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">focus groups</a> to help shape future development sessions, a few key points rose to the surface: Employees not only wanted better skills for accomplishing their job tasks &#8212; they also wanted to know WHY those job tasks are important to the company. Furthermore, they strongly stated that they wanted trainers who are good at teaching. By seeking employee feedback, you&#8217;ll already be ahead of the game, because <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/2018/12/leveraging-recognition-and-feedback-to-boost-employee-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">employee engagement increases</a> when people feel that their company listens and responds to feedback.</p>
<h2>Take advantage of the amazing new training and development options</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve looked away for a minute or two from the cutting edge of augmented and virtual reality, you may have missed the fact that these technologies are the new giants in the workplace training and development field. Police forces around the world are now being prepared for their jobs by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/charliefink/2017/10/30/vr-training-next-generation-of-workers/#698a1dc564f5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">360-degree virtual environments</a>, as are employees in the transportation, retail and healthcare industries. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2016/09/20/hyper-training-and-the-future-augmented-reality-workplace/#7444987b28b0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Newman</a>, CEO of Broadsuite Media Group, says that he is &#8220;exhilarated by the possibilities inherent in augmented reality (AR) workplace training.&#8221; He goes on to explain, &#8220;Not only does AR open the doors for limitless creativity and innovation, it also enables enterprises to speed up the training process and make it more beneficial to employees.&#8221; Digital options for training and development in every industry are multiplying rapidly, and they promise to save your company money while improving productivity. Plus the technology is new enough to have some flash and dazzle, simply making it fun for everyone involved.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23953" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/helloquence-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="training and development" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/helloquence-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/helloquence-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/helloquence-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>You can come up with plenty of solid numbers to justify the expense of workforce training and development programs, but it&#8217;s really all about employee engagement. A well-executed training and development program will result in workers who care more about today&#8217;s tasks and are more hopeful about tomorrow&#8217;s opportunities.

But employee performance isn’t a dial you can turn up or down at will. Many factors determine how productive your employees are, and they vary from position to position or even individual to individual. This makes measuring employee performance, let alone improving it, a real challenge — but one you can overcome with the tips below.</p>
<h2>How do you measure employee performance?</h2>
<p>Measuring employee performance is challenging but possible. Looking at obvious metrics like sales made or number of IT issues resolved can be useful in some cases. But it won’t give you the full picture of an employee’s productivity, and some positions lack any tangible output to measure. Thankfully, there are some useful yardsticks that apply to most employees’ work.</p>
<p>Efficiency is a good example. Tracking the time it takes for employees to complete tasks each week or month will reveal important ongoing trends and areas for improvement. Of course, being able to finish a huge project in a short amount of time means nothing if the quality of the work is poor. Think about a sliding scale you can use to measure an employee’s work in terms of the value it brings to the company, or devise another way to track quality along with efficiency.</p>
<p>Another objective metric is employees’ <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/5-performance-measurement-myths/">engagement levels</a>. Engaged team members are more likely to push themselves by trying new things or giving extra effort beyond their day-to-day assignments. Seventy-one percent of executives say that <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-impact-of-employee-engagement-on-performance-by-harvard-business-review-analytic-services/">employee engagement is a very important part of overall organizational success</a>.</p>
<p>If you have an employee engagement platform, train managers to examine the data behind engagement from frequent employee engagement surveys. If they don’t see positive trends in the drivers of engagement, like recognition and connection within teams, an engagement solution makes it easy to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">transition from analysis to building a collaborative action plan</a> that the entire team is behind.</p>
<p>When you’re nailing down key metrics, keep in mind that evaluating employee productivity is a two-way street. Unilaterally assigning metrics employees don’t believe are valuable or accurate isn’t going to get them to do their best work. Get mutual buy-in to ensure that the employee is motivated to work towards their goals. And no matter what metrics the employee and their manager choose, communicating exactly how and when the employee’s success will be measured is a must. Laying out expectations clearly gets everyone on the same page and ensures there are no surprises during evaluation time.</p>

<h2>8 steps to improve employee performance</h2>
<p>Once you’ve narrowed down the ways you plan to measure employee productivity, it’s time to start improving it. Here are 8 steps you can take to boost work performance.</p>
<h3>1. Set clear, realistic goals — and hold people to them</h3>
<p>It’s impossible for employees to exceed expectations if those expectations are nonexistent or unclear. Unrealistic goals immediately demoralize even the most enthusiastic employees, while achieving easy goals isn’t impactful and doesn&#8217;t propel employees forward in their careers. Try to strike a balance. Goals should be ambitious, yet achievable, and there should be a defined way for employees to measure their progress.</p>
<p>When it comes time for a quarterly or yearly review, advise managers to pull up the goals they set with each employee at the beginning of the year. Recommend that managers think about employee performance <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/6-tips-to-tackle-performance-reviews-for-managers-and-employees/">based on input from other peers, department heads, and clients</a>. Take into account any awards or significant recognition employees may have received as well.</p>
<p>During evaluation periods, make it clear that everyone is accountable for his or her performance. This especially applies to managers. Senior leaders should set an example by <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/feedback-for-managers/">asking for and acting on 360-degree feedback</a>. Doing so helps employees feel like their opinions are valuable, too.</p>
<p>When managers feel an employees’ goal was not met, they should investigate why. Encourage them to keep conversations positive and productive by <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-feedback-examples/">delivering specific feedback and then focusing on how they can help</a>. Working together to develop an action plan ensures the employee can stick to it.</p>
<h3>2. Build a positive work environment and culture</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/organizational-culture-definition/">Culture plays a huge role in your employees’ effectiveness</a>. A negative culture is demotivating, perpetuates burnout, and contributes to high turnover. Conversely, positivity, recognition, and teamwork keep employees healthy and happy. And that matters — <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/about-us/app/uploads/sites/2/2019/07/Mission-Culture-Survey-Supplement.pdf">77% of workers consider a company’s culture before applying</a>, and companies with highly aligned cultures see <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/business-case-culture-alignment/">30% higher enterprise value growth and 17% higher profit growth</a>.</p>
<p>But building a high-performance culture takes more than simply publishing a mission or vision statement. It’s about <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/company-core-value-examples/">choosing inspiring company values</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-rewards-ideas/">rewarding employees</a> who live out those values each day. The culture of your organization should create an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/psychological-safety-at-work/">environment of psychological safety</a> by emphasizing the need for mutual respect, interpersonal trust, and support for employees’ mental, emotional, and physical health. Employees should feel comfortable being themselves in your organization. An inclusive, strong culture is especially vital in times of crisis. Keeping employees informed and inspired helps companies tackle challenges as a team.</p>
<h3>3. Recognize and incentivize employees</h3>
<p>When people are acknowledged and rewarded for a job well done, they put more energy and effort into their everyday tasks. Organizations that rate their culture of recognition highly are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">two times as likely to see improved employee engagement</a>. And 72% of executives believe that <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-impact-of-employee-engagement-on-performance-by-harvard-business-review-analytic-services/">recognition given to high performers has a significant impact on employee engagement</a>.</p>
<p>To get the most out of recognition, make sure it’s <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/recognition-letter/">specific, frequent, and timely</a>. Explicitly linking recognition to an action <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">makes employees more inclined to repeat that behavior in the future</a>. Frequent recognition adds to that inclination, and cultivates trust among employees and their peers and managers.</p>
<p>Monetary and social recognition are both key parts of the recognition puzzle. To give employees a choice in how they are rewarded, implement a points-based rewards system. Whenever an employee is recognized, they accumulate points that can be redeemed for any prize in your rewards catalog. This type of recognition and rewards platform <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/how-to-integrate-recognition-into-your-everyday-work-life/">integrates recognition into employees’ daily routine</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-rewards-ideas/">gives employees a sense of autonomy</a> over how they are compensated for hard work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/social-recognition-what-why-and-how/">Social recognition</a> can be even more impactful than rewards: companies that invest in social recognition are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/">two times more likely to improve individual employee performance</a>. Examples of social recognition include shouting out a direct report in an all-hands meeting, writing a peer a thank you note, or publicizing an accomplishment on your company’s intranet. Urge everyone to get involved, as peer-to-peer recognition <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/peer-to-peer-recognition/">promotes team spirit, gives employees an equal voice, and improves self-esteem</a>. To make social recognition easy, adopt a recognition platform that lets employees show appreciation when and where works best for them with mobile capabilities and a great user experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-incentive-programs/">Great incentives</a> can enhance work performance as well. Beyond obvious incentives like bonuses, extra PTO, and raises, think about more creative options, such as <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-rewards-ideas/">donating to charities in employees’ names or giving employees a day off each quarter to volunteer</a>. Celebrating big milestones with experiences like concerts or paid vacations can be huge motivators as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/"><em><strong>Find out how inclusive and frequent recognition can impact your business.</strong></em></a></p>
<h3>4. Listen to your workforce</h3>
<p>It’s hard to maximize employee productivity without knowing what employees are struggling with and how they think they can better contribute to your company. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">Give employees a voice</a> by creating opportunities for them to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">share their perspectives, ideas, and worries without fear of retaliation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">Pulse surveys</a> are a fantastic way to gather information about particular topics and see how employees’ views change over time. They’re relatively short and are easy to answer quickly, so they don’t interrupt employees’ workflows. You can get insight into all the factors that contribute to employee engagement, like <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-questions/">alignment, recognition, and more</a>. Be sure to leave room for open-ended questions, too. Allowing employees to give free-form feedback can elicit the most insightful responses.</p>
<p>And for immediate feedback, turn to AI-powered HR chatbots. These <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">always-on feedback tools</a> invite employees to share their observations frequently and confidentially. Sixty-four percent of HR leaders agree that an always-on feedback tool is <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/empowerment-and-trust-the-keys-to-employee-engagement/">critical to an engagement program</a>.</p>
<p>Remember, collecting feedback is only the first step in listening to your workforce. Managers need to analyze and act on feedback. This encourages employees to exercise their voice more and demonstrates that they have the power to influence decisions at work. Look for an employee engagement solution that anonymizes employee data to remove emotion from the equation as much as possible and review the data with an objective, open frame of mind.</p>
<p>Once managers identify a few areas for improvement, teach them how to prioritize with the help of your engagement platform’s analytics features. Not everything can be addressed at once. Encourage managers to pick just one or two issues to focus on each quarter and create collaborative plans with their direct reports.</p>
<h3>5. Keep morale high</h3>
<p>High employee morale leads to high engagement, while poor morale manifests in turnover, disempowerment, and even health issues. And <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/morale-contagious-disease-manny-lavery">low morale is contagious</a>, so keeping employees happy can make or break your organization’s performance. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to raise morale and maintain it at a high level.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, recognition is a fantastic way to keep morale high. Building a culture of recognition starts with an organization’s leaders. They should acknowledge others often and in a way that’s memorable and meaningful.</p>
<p>Beyond recognition, remind supervisors not to micromanage. They should instead think of ways to e<a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-empowerment/">nable employees to take initiative themselves</a>, provide them with the resources they need, and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/building-trust-workplace/">trust them to get their work done on time</a>. Leadership should also listen attentively to employee feedback and communicate with their teams as effectively as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/empowerment-and-trust-the-keys-to-employee-engagement/">Learn why empowerment and trust are the keys to a successful workforce.</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>6. Help employees practice self-care</h3>
<p>Caring for employees’ emotional and mental health is crucial to preventing burnout. Overworked employees suffer from <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/burnout-job/">disengagement, physical health issues, and feelings of isolation</a>. Employees who experience burnout are <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/288539/employee-burnout-biggest-myth.aspx">63% more likely to call in sick and 23% more likely to take a trip to the emergency room</a>.</p>
<p>Institute wellness programs that help your employees maintain habits like <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/habits-drive-superior-employee-performance/">exercising regularly, getting enough restful sleep, and eating nourishing meals</a>. Each of these behaviors maximize employees’ energy and ability to focus. Some rewards platforms allow employees to track <a href="https://www.achievers.com/press/achievers-launches-integration-with-wellright-to-streamline-employee-rewards-recognition-and-wellness/">progress towards their health goals</a>. Every month, reward people who have consistently added good habits to their wellness routine.</p>
<p>Encourage employees to tend to their mental health as well. Pay for subscriptions to meditation apps like Headspace or Calm, or even hire a professional to host meditation sessions in-house from time to time. The mindfulness that comes with meditation helps employees become more adaptable and better handle stress. In addition to decluttering the mind, mindfulness boosts employees’ empathy, which can <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/mindfulness-at-work-culture-of-mindful-leadership-empathy/">improve both your company culture and the client experience</a>.</p>
<p>And don’t forget to encourage employees to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oyo-ZX23URtdf8ynknBqsTDSNv28IraR3wK1jueNnXU/edit#">actually use their time off</a>. Spending time with family and friends helps employees distance themselves from work and come back recharged and refreshed.</p>
<h3>7. Support training and professional development</h3>
<p>There is a direct connection between providing development opportunities and a high-performing workforce. Continuous learning gives employees the skills they need to move into more powerful and impactful roles. And it’s a win-win for your company: organizations that invest in training <a href="https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5545222">have 24% higher profit margins</a>.</p>
<p>There are so many ways you can support professional development. One is to send employees to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/3-ways-promote-professional-growth/">industry conferences or relevant training programs</a>. They’ll hear about best practices and innovative technologies to help them become more competent and forward-thinking. You can also give scholarships to employees pursuing further education, or you can cover the cost of certification exams. This enables employees to gain new expertise in ways they might not have been able to afford otherwise.</p>
<p>Rewarding employees with <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-rewards-ideas/">one-on-one coaching sessions with executives</a> is another excellent idea. In these smaller settings, employees receive tailored advice and develop relationships with key business stakeholders who can guide them throughout their careers. You can train managers to become better mentors as well. By <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/managers-as-coaches/">adopting a “coach” mentality</a>, managers can build rapport, make their teams more confident, and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/upskilling-your-employees/">foster a sense of belonging</a>.</p>
<h3>8. Support your employees with the best tools</h3>
<p>Following the steps above is easier said than done. The good news is that there are tools to make it simpler. Employee engagement and employee recognition solutions <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/unhappy-employees-unhappy-customers-how-to-break-the-lose-lose-cycle/">improve both the employee and customer experience</a>. They’re typically software-as-a-service platforms, making them easy to use and learn. HR chooses each tool and then trains leadership and employees on how to use them effectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">End-to-end employee engagement tools</a> help people leaders gather and interpret data to optimize organizational performance. Continuous listening features give managers insight into how their teams are responding to new challenges. This allows them to make swift pivots and lead their teams to success.

<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-software/">Recognition platforms</a> are instrumental in producing positive performance results as well. Recognizing others should be easy and fun for any employee. To reap the most benefits, pick a platform that supports both social and points-based recognition. It should also make the recognition experience engaging with the ability to like, comment on, and provide additional points to any individual message of appreciation. Integrating with widely-used communication tools and meshing well with your chosen engagement platform are pluses as well.</p>

</ul>
<h2>How to win the war for talent </h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So how do you rise above the fray to emerge victorious in the war for talent? Here’s what you need to know:</span></p>
<h2>1. Build relationships with universities</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Talent is key for productivity, so it makes sense to go directly to the source. Establishing a strong presence on local college campuses </span><a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/strategic-campus-recruiting.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">builds brand awareness</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, so you can create some buzz for your business as a great place to work just as the youngest employees are considering their options. It’s also a great strategy to build partnerships for internships and learning with relevant academic departments. In this way you can help develop the exact skill sets you’re looking for to boost performance when you hire.</span></p>
<h2>2. Compensation is just the start</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Compensation is important, of course, and you’ll need to make sure you’re in line with the competition. But at the end of the day, a </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/compensation-wins-talent-recognition-retains-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">sky-high paycheck doesn’t lead to motivation</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, and it’s no guarantee that your new hire will excel in their position — or even stick around for very long. Fair pay and a balanced benefits packages are important, but you’re unlikely to be able to differentiate your company on this front, so don’t fight a losing battle by putting all your eggs a basket that ultimately looks like every other basket on offer.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23883" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/02-18-2019-2.jpg" alt="compensation war for talent" width="750" height="250" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/02-18-2019-2.jpg 750w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/02-18-2019-2-300x100.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h2>3. Compete on company culture</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If you can’t stand out with money, do it with culture. When pay is basically the same across the board, you need to differentiate by being a </span><i><span data-contrast="none">great</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> place to work. You can’t mandate culture — you have to build it. This is best done through:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

Today’s employees want frequent recognition. According to an Achievers report, <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/2020-engagement-retention-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">91 percent</a> of employees said they &#8220;strongly&#8221; or &#8220;somewhat&#8221; agreed a strong recognition culture makes a company attractive to work for. There are dozens of ways to recognize employees, from digital celebration cards and gift cards to corporate outings. If you don&#8217;t already have an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/what-we-offer/recognize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">employee recognition program</a> in place, it&#8217;s time to consider one. Building a </span><a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/recognition-culture-the-mvp-of-employee-experience/"><span data-contrast="none">culture of recognition</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> encourages employees to recognize another</span><span data-contrast="none"> (</span><span data-contrast="none">whether peer-to-peer or top-down</span><span data-contrast="none">)</span><span data-contrast="none"> in the moment and on a frequent basis.

Employees long to be heard! When you survey them regularly and build in ways to gather their ideas, feedback, and inspiration, you don’t just show you care: you also find ways to streamline processes, eliminate waste, and build on your success. Regular pulse surveys are a great place to start — as long as take action on the feedback you receive.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> Incorporating employee feedback into your company culture is critical considering <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/2020-engagement-retention-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">90 percent</a> of workers say they are more likely to stay at an employer that takes and acts on feedback.</span></li>

<h2>4. Train the next generation of leaders</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The master stroke of strategy for winning the war for talent comes when you commit to developing internal talent. A full </span><a href="https://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/2019/04/19/what-does-gen-z-want-from-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">60 percent of Gen-Z employees aspire to management positions</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, and they have sky-high expectations about being promoted within the first year of employment. While that may not be realistic, you can groom them for moving up the ladder with leadership development initiatives and scaffolded learning that lets them gradually take on more responsibility. Showing employees you trust them and want to build a future with them is one of the best ways to keep them engaged and loyal—and you’ll also create an in-house talent pool to draw from, instead of maintaining an endless cycle of recruiting.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<h2>Why employee retention matters</h2>
<p>Employee retention needs to be top of mind for any company, as the cost of losing top talent is great. SHRM estimates that it <a href="https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/employee-retention-the-real-cost-of-losing-an-employee">costs $20,000 to $30,000 in recruiting and training expenses</a> to replace a manager making $40,000 a year. This doesn’t even account for losses in terms of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-engage-retain-your-employees-during-covid-dan-schawbel/">interview time, knowledge, productivity, or cultural impact</a>. And low retention rates also impact motivation, productivity, and performance. Before employees quit, they may become less of a team player, do the minimum amount of work, and fail to commit to long-term deadlines.</p>
<p>HR isn’t powerless, though — <a href="https://info.workinstitute.com/hubfs/2019%20Retention%20Report/Work%20Institute%202019%20Retention%20Report%20final-1.pdf">77% of the reasons behind employee departures are preventable</a>. The key is to pinpoint the issues that may be driving employees to leave and address them before it’s too late.</p>

<h3>1. Build employee engagement</h3>
<p>Disengaged employees are detrimental to your organization. They bring down morale, discourage other employees from doing their best work, and set poor examples. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/workforce-institute-2021-engagement-and-retention-report/">only 21% of employees say they’re very engaged</a>, and disengaged employees cost the U.S. over $450 billion per year in lost productivity.</p>
<p>Few things bring down engagement like failing to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/">give employees a voice</a>. Employees want to influence decisions that affect their work and the direction of the organization, and giving employees a real say can dramatically improve retention. Turning feedback into action demonstrates that leadership takes employees’ concerns seriously. Ninety percent of workers say that they are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">more likely to stay at a company that takes and acts on feedback</a>. But <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2018-employee-engagement-survey/">only 22% of HR and engagement leaders</a> say their organization is effective at creating a culture that supports clear feedback.</p>
<p>Introducing new opportunities for employees to give candid feedback is valuable to them and your company. Employees can highlight problems before they surface to higher-ups, suggest new projects, and lend outside perspectives to company decisions. Organizations can capitalize on employee ideas and address issues quickly and effectively.</p>
<p>Giving employees a voice starts with employee engagement surveys delivered with the aid of a modern engagement platform. These solutions help you <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-questions/">ask the right questions</a> to reveal how employees truly feel about their role, team, and manager. Rather than settling for long annual surveys that aren’t actionable, use <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">pulse surveys</a>, short sets of questions sent on a recurring basis, to measure employee engagement in real time.</p>
<p>Outside of surveys, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">HR chatbots</a> are a great way to create an always-on channel for employee feedback. 24/7 chatbots allow employees to give feedback whenever they are ready, wherever they are, ensuring that they feel heard regularly. These AI-powered tools are constantly learning so they keep up with your organization’s ever-changing employee engagement landscape.</p>
<p>Analyzing and acting on the feedback you receive is just as important as collecting it. Are people responding to surveys or chatbots? If not, switch up the questions or take action more visibly and frequently. If so, what results were most surprising, and why? The best employee engagement solutions help quickly identify the most pressing challenges and guide managers through the process of <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">creating collaborative action plans</a> with their teams.</p>
<h3>2. Get recognition and rewards right</h3>
<p>Employees who feel appreciated <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">work harder and stay at companies longer</a>, but <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/forget-cash-here-are-better-ways-to-motivate-employees?cid=spmailing-24801079-WK%20Newsletter%2001-30-2019%20(1)-January%2030,%202019&amp;_lrsc=8eaa8008-191d-4cf4-b763-2f8d068a8f30">over 80% of American employees say they don’t feel recognized or rewarded</a>. Building a culture of recognition is more than recognizing people every once in a while. It requires frequent, specific acknowledgment. The Brandon Hall Group found that companies that recognize employees multiple times a month are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">41% more likely to see increased employee retention</a> and 34% more likely to see increased engagement.</p>
<p>To make consistent recognition a reality, your organization should prioritize both <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/">social recognition</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-rewards-ideas/">monetary rewards</a>, preferably by <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-software/">using a recognition platform</a> that helps everyone get in on the action. These platforms support points-based reward systems that let employees accumulate and redeem points for rewards that actually matter to them. And they make showing recognition easy whether employees are in office or working remotely, as they can send messages of appreciation to anyone at your organization whenever and wherever works best for them.</p>

<h3>3. Recruit the right employees</h3>
<p>The best employees want to be around others that inspire them, not those that bring them down. Find <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/7-creative-ways-attract-top-talent/">ways to attract first-rate candidates</a> who align with your culture and will stick with your company for years to come. For example, while employees expect to sell themselves, they also want to be sold on your company. What interesting aspects of your culture can you emphasize on your careers page? Do you have amazing fringe benefits like monthly massages, onsite fitness centers, or generous parental leave policies? Did your company land in a “Best Places to Work” list? Think about how to best position your work environment for each candidate and position.</p>
<p>You can also look into <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/4-tips-for-recruiting-top-talent-with-gamification/">gamifying recruiting</a>, which is a great way to make the process fun. From hackathons to digital games to fictional VR scenarios, the possibilities offered by gamification are limitless. Those who opt into these games are expressing interest in your company, and the winners will likely be dedicated to the role they are applying for.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the best candidates don’t always come from Ivy League schools. Build relationships with <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/6-tips-how-to-effectively-attract-and-hire-stem-talent/">professional groups, community college career offices, and other relevant associations</a> to get a more diverse applicant pool. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/becoming-an-employer-of-choice-best-practices-to-recruit-retain-and-shine/">Cater to different generations’ needs</a> by offering professional development opportunities, flexible schedules, and the ability to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/recruiting-remote-workers/">work remotely</a>. Spotlighting a strong culture of recognition is important, too. <a href="https://gethppy.com/employee-engagement/millennials-want-to-see-your-company-values">Almost half of millennials</a> prefer to be rewarded or recognized for their work at least monthly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-28449" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Appreciation_Day_Blog_image_960x540px.v2-300x169.png" alt="" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Appreciation_Day_Blog_image_960x540px.v2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Appreciation_Day_Blog_image_960x540px.v2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Appreciation_Day_Blog_image_960x540px.v2.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3>4. Create an exceptional onboarding experience</h3>
<p>Making employees feel like a part of your organization starts with their onboarding and continues through their first year at the company. It can take a new employee <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/infographics-slideshares/6-stats-that-speak-to-employee-retention/">up to two full years to reach the same level of productivity</a> as an existing staff member, so making them feel comfortable and capable at the outset can do wonders for retention.</p>
<p>Help new employees <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/successful-onboarding/">shift from an outsider to insider</a> by educating them about their responsibilities, giving them the agency and resources needed to complete their tasks and goals, and creating an environment where they feel accepted. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/effectively-get-new-hires-speed/">Don’t inundate people with too much information</a>, though. Trickle it out slowly with digestible guidelines on your HR programs, policies and procedures, and benefits. And ask employees for feedback so you can keep iterating on your onboarding process.</p>
<p>Managers have a big role to play during onboarding. Remind them that how well onboarding goes can affect <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/all-aboard-how-employee-onboarding-can-affect-the-rest-of-their-tenure/">how connected the employees are to the organization throughout their tenure</a>. Suggest ways for them to get to know their new employees and encourage them to set up one-on-one meetings each week as the new person is getting acclimated.</p>
<p>Introduce new hires to their teammates as well, and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/how-to-improve-employee-onboarding-with-mentorship-programs/">set them up with a mentor</a> so that they have someone on-hand to answer questions. B<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/your-new-hires-wont-succeed-unless-you-onboard-them-properly">uilding social connections</a> between coworkers increases the likelihood of retention, so host events that rally people around shared interests when large cohorts of new hires come on board. You should also <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/onboarding-remote-employees/">ensure that remote employees aren’t left behind when it comes to onboarding</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, don’t forget about finding ways to integrate <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/four-people-forgot-onboarding-program/">groups who might be returning to work</a>. This might include new parents, people coming back from extended leave, or contract workers who are signing on full-time. These employees often aren’t included in onboarding efforts, but their transitions can be just as difficult as those new hires face.</p>
<h3>5. Provide avenues for professional development</h3>
<p>The total loss to a business from ineffective training can <a href="https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/statistics-on-corporate-training-and-what-they-mean-for-your-companys-future">add up to $13.5 million each year per 1,000 employees</a>. Unsurprisingly, there is a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/neglecting-employee-development-affects-roi/">direct link between low investment in employee development and staff turnover</a>. On the flip side, supporting professional development and continuous learning uplifts your employees and boosts retention.</p>
<p>Educating your employees, setting up clear career paths, and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/managers-as-coaches/">instituting coaching programs</a> makes everyone more creative, engaged, and effective at work. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/leverage-learning-development-improve-employee-engagement/">Explore providing reimbursement for continuing education and certification programs</a>, as well as industry events and conferences. You can also host <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/3-ways-promote-professional-growth/">internal knowledge sharing sessions</a> where employees teach one another new skills. Give your employees options depending on how they want to grow, and remember, it’s possible to encourage development in targeted ways without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>Lastly, ask managers to take chances on employees who have shown interest in a new area by giving them a side project to work on. Doing so shows employees that their bosses care about their career trajectory and trust them to bring their expertise to other areas of the business.</p>
<h3>6. Build a culture employees want to be a part of</h3>
<p>Culture is paramount to attracting and retaining top talent. Glassdoor found that <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/about-us/app/uploads/sites/2/2019/07/Mission-Culture-Survey-Supplement.pdf">77% of workers consider a company’s culture</a> before applying, and the Associated Press reports that <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-businesswire/7c779ac701724a4686ce454d5b33ccba">nearly half of employees would leave their current job</a> for a lower-paying one at an organization with a better culture. Cultivating a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/organizational-culture-definition/">strong organizational culture</a> will deepen existing employee relationships, pave the way for better customer service, and draw in exceptional talent.</p>
<p>Developing a standout culture involves rewarding people who <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/company-core-value-examples/">act on your company’s values</a> every day. These values should be meaningful to every employee and communicated in a way that everyone can internalize and understand. Tie company goals to your products and services, and outline how your company’s mission plays into how your employees work with partners, customers, and vendors. And if you&#8217;re rewriting your core values or trying to establish more company alignment, ask your employees for help. After all, they experience your company culture every day and have the context needed to shape truly meaningful values.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-culture-report/">Discover whether your company has the culture needed to thrive in times of crisis and uncertainty.</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>7. Offer winning incentives</h3>
<p>Incentives are a concrete way to acknowledge employees for fantastic work. Eighty-five percent of workers <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8506-employee-productivity-incentives.html">feel more motivated to do their best</a> when an incentive is offered. There are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-incentive-programs/">endless ways to incentivize your employees</a>. First, make sure that the compensation your organization offers is appropriate 一 it’s a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/workers-quit-their-jobs-at-the-fastest-rate-on-record-in-2019.html">major reason behind employee departures</a>. Then think about other monetary incentives like referral programs, tuition reimbursement, and profit-sharing. Bonuses and raises are always appreciated as well.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other incentives that keep your employees healthy and happy. Wellness rewards like gym memberships or subscriptions to meditation apps can help your employees unwind and take care of themselves. Giving managers a stipend to put on fun events each month, letting employees choose what projects they work on, and providing extra paid time off to rest and recharge are also excellent options that motivate just as well as more traditional incentives.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-27735" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brooke-cagle-uHVRvDr7pg-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="Employee Incentive Programs to Engage Your Team" width="551" height="367" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brooke-cagle-uHVRvDr7pg-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brooke-cagle-uHVRvDr7pg-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brooke-cagle-uHVRvDr7pg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px" /></p>
<h3>8. Manage to retain</h3>
<p>The relationship between managers and their direct reports can make an enormous impact on the employee experience. <a href="https://research.udemy.com/research_report/udemy-in-depth-2018-employee-experience-report/">Almost half of employees quit their job because of a bad manager</a>, and 60% think their managers need training. And according to Gallup, only <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/257582/feedback-not-enough.aspx">26% of employees</a> strongly agree the feedback they get from managers helps their work performance.</p>
<p>The best managers act as coaches and focus on getting the best out of their direct reports. They’re optimistic, assertive, recognize employee value, and provide actionable feedback. A coaching approach fosters mutual trust, making it feel like bosses and their direct reports are on the same team. Perhaps most importantly, coaching reduces stress. By setting goals, giving workers autonomy, and evaluating progress often, employees know exactly where they stand and where they need to go.</p>
<p>Coaching works because managers take the time to understand each employee’s background and play to their individual strengths. Gallup found that workers who know and use their strengths <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/282647/give-bossing-coaching-results.aspx">average 10 to 19% increased sales</a> and help boost their organization’s bottom line.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/why-leaders-need-to-be-recognition-champions/">Managers who recognize employees consistently</a> reap the benefits in terms of improved employee confidence and engagement. <a href="https://www.business2community.com/human-resources/10-employee-recognition-stats-cant-ignore-01878458">Fifty percent of employees</a> say that being thanked by managers improved their relationship and built trust.</p>
<h3>9. Prevent burnout by focusing on employee wellness</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/burnout-job/">Employee burnout</a> is a major issue in the United States, and it’s occuring at an alarming rate 一 7<a href="https://www.bamboohr.com/blog/examining-employee-burnout/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20Gallup%20report,called%20it%20a%20workplace%20epidemic.">6% of employees experience burnout</a> on the job. Burnout symptoms like a lack of energy, negative emotions, and feelings of isolation are endemic and tough to overcome. Burnout can even manifest physically, leaving employees with no choice but to leave your organization.</p>
<p>The good news is that your organization can nip burnout in the bud. Try giving employees more flexible hours, and make sure that responsibilities and expectations are clear and appropriate. Teach managers to look for signs of burnout and reach out to people who might be struggling. Encourage employees to use their vacation time and help them find hobbies that ignite their curiosity. Arrange fitness challenges, host a webinar on the importance of sleep, or even have a nutritionist give a talk on healthy eating habits.</p>
<p>Finally, ask your employees for feedback. They probably know exactly what is causing burnout in your organization and have ideas on how to combat it.</p>

Their technology aims to transform healthcare with cloud-based software that has a meaningful impact on people’s lives. And so, it was natural for the organization to seek a platform partner that could help to transform <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/things-your-ceo-needs-to-know-about-employee-engagement/">employee engagement</a> at PointClickCare and nurture a corporate culture focused on both people and performance.</p>
<p>To reach and engage their more than 1,800 employees, PointClickCare partnered with Achievers to fulfill three main objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish a program that would be readily adopted and accessible to all</li>
<li>Create a culture of recognition that extended beyond the program’s boundaries</li>
<li>Engage leadership in recognition across the organization</li>
</ol>
<h2>Culture as their competitive advantage</h2>
<p>PointClickCare’s founder and CEO believes that <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/why-organizational-culture-is-a-competitive-differentiator/">culture</a> is the single competitive advantage for any organization. And to get culture right, you have to be deliberate about it.</p>
<p>The organization aptly named their employee engagement program iCare, recognizing and rewarding employees with both social and points-based recognition based on company values:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Day Brightener — Team Player — Solution Solver — You Rock</strong><br />
<strong>People — Passion — Performance</strong></p>
<p>PointClickCare centered their program around facilitating <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/peer-to-peer-recognition/">peer-to-peer</a> recognition in celebration of milestones such as birthdays and service anniversaries. To allow for customization, departments created their own modules to help reinforce behaviors specific to the respective team’s success.</p>
<p>Building on the buzz and activity around creating a culture of recognition, PointClickCare decided to launch a company-wide event, the iCare Awards, to celebrate the employees who gave and received the greatest number of recognitions over the past year. And they didn’t let the onset of the pandemic stop them from hosting their red carpet-style event. PointClickCare took their awards virtual, providing a critical touchpoint for their employees in the early days of the pandemic and creating an opportunity for real-time connection and shared experience between employees during a difficult time.</p>
<p><strong>The impact</strong>: Throughout the week of the iCare Awards, PointClickCare employees sent an average of 1.2 recognitions each — a <strong>1,209% increase</strong> from the week prior. And, the awards generated a <strong>123% increase</strong> in social recognitions across the platform YoY. This initiative had a truly amazing — and immediate — impact.</p>
<h2>It’s a go for additional online campaigns</h2>
<p>Keen to harness the benefit of centralizing their other company-wide programs, PointClickCare migrated additional celebrations into iCare, including: wellness campaigns, milestone moments highlighting service anniversaries, and employee appreciation week.</p>
<p>The incorporation of these initiatives into their Achievers platform not only meant a consistent experience and central hub for all things employee engagement — it also allowed for reporting and insight into the impacts of their efforts. For instance, following employee appreciation week, monthly active users on the platform <strong>spiked by 62%</strong> over the previous month and has <strong>remained 24% higher</strong> than their baseline ever since.</p>
<h2>Undeniable impact</h2>
<p>With 99% of PointClickCare employees having activated their accounts and 100% activation among managers, the iCare has become an intrinsic element of their company culture. The program has even become a staple in their cafeteria, where a large screen displays their live newsfeed of recognitions sent and received.</p>
<p>Uptake of the program has led to measurable impacts on employee engagement. Following the implementation of their Achievers program, <strong>PointClickCare employee engagement scores registered at 89%</strong> — a score that beats the best-in-class benchmark of 86%. The organization has also evolved their engagement survey to include a focus on recognition with questions such as, “My direct manager provides me with recognition for good work.” To this question, employees responded with a 85% positive rating, putting the organization on par with the best-in-class top 10% global benchmark. These figures are merely the beginning of what is sure to be an outstanding employee engagement and recognition journey for PointClickCare and their people.</p>
<h2>A bright future</h2>
<p>Recognized as one of Canada’s Most Admired Cultures by Waterstone, PointClickCare continues to strive for excellence in championing employee engagement through frequent and meaningful recognition.</p>

<ul>
<li>Increasing complexity of the R&amp;R processes involved</li>
<li>Ability to serve a multi-generational workforce</li>
<li>Disruptions caused by advancements in the HR tech market</li>
<li>Increasing employee-centric focuses</li>
<li>Need to make employee motivation intrinsic</li>
<li>Demand for a holistic employee experience solution</li>
</ul>
<p>The rewards and recognition (R&amp;R) industry’s evolution started during the close of the 20th century. This is when enterprises realized the importance of performance-based bonuses and physical and symbolic rewards such as trophies and plaques and recognized that these were a greater driver of productivity and motivation than previously leveraged employee benefits such as paid leaves and health benefits. With this, the R&amp;R industry embarked on its outsourcing journey, which featured rewards manufacturers and delivery providers.</p>
<p>Over the next 20 years, enterprises came to realize that rewards alone were not sufficient to make their employees feel valued. With technology paving the path, several players in the market started focusing on building platform-based solutions for recognizing and socializing with peers. This was a significant development brought about by the technology revolution and continues to be at the heart of the whole employee experience ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now, with next-generation technology gaining popularity, the industry is largely being defined by several tech-based players. By leveraging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), chatbots, automation, and predictive and prescriptive analytics, their R&amp;R platforms have become smarter, more intuitive, and highly user-friendly.</p>
<p>Key trends and use cases in the R&amp;R platform space include:</p>
<h2>#1 AI- and ML-based use cases for a smarter R&amp;R platform</h2>
<p>AI-based engines allow HR managers and program administrators to align employees with the organization’s values and objectives through KPIs and benchmarks. By implementing ML, employers can deliver personalized content and tailored rewards and benefits to employees, thus driving better incentive programs.</p>
<p>The most common use case of this technology is building a culture of recognition by sending just-in-time recognition reminders and nudges to team managers and senior leadership on employees’ service anniversaries and other relevant life events. But more recently, organizations have begun using AI to analyze employee’s sentiments and gauge word patterns to understand employees’ emotions. This helps HR team leaders develop strategies to uplift employees’ moods, stem attrition, and ensure a superior employee experience.</p>
<p>Another popular use case is around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&amp;I). Here, specific words and phrases are fed into the system to detect bias toward employees based on their gender, race, etc. When it detects a biased statement, it flags it to the user and suggests appropriate language changes in the message, thus providing a learning experience for the user. This is an essential use case as it addresses the growing attention and unrest caused by racist behavior and gender inequality around the world.</p>
<p>Chatbots are frequently used in employee experience suites for engagement analytics to track employees’ sentiments through one-on-one “conversations” with employees. The chatbot technology can also be embedded within frequently used applications such as Microsoft Office and Slack to streamline recognition and send appreciation.</p>
<p>Rewards services can be enhanced by bringing together automation and intelligent chatbots, wherein the chatbots handle complex rewards issues regarding ordering, processing, tracking, and delivery of rewards and provide an immediate resolution.</p>
<h2>#2 Automating the R&amp;R experience</h2>
<p>Automation is an essential tool for improving the employee experience and, thus, as part of an R&amp;R platform. Automation enables automatic delivery of rewards and recognition to employees on special occasions, thereby reducing the administrative burden on human employees. It also allows managers to automatically approve pending nomination requests for monetary recognition.</p>
<p>Use cases that enhance the accessibility of the platform for users are automatic language translation through detection of an employee’s geographical location and automatic application of a standard of living/cost of living increase for employees wherever they work in the world.</p>
<p>Some leading service providers are also exploring use cases using Robotic Process Automation (RPA), a more advanced form of automation, to develop, for example, automated workflows that track data on the time taken to send an employee recognition or for an employee to redeem rewards points. Such an operation is performed by the vendor on behalf of the client company.</p>
<h2>#3 Drawing insights using advanced analytics</h2>
<p>Enterprises are increasingly using robust data collection and analytics tools to collect and visualize data on their workforce, and to track key R&amp;R metrics such as employee reach, points utilization, and managers’ and team members’ recognition moments to calculate employee recognition scores. These are particularly useful for decision-makers in evaluating the effectiveness of the platform and developing recognition strategies to bolster the R&amp;R program.</p>
<p>An extremely valuable use case relates to learning and development for managers. This combines the power of eclectic data assimilation and prescriptive analytics to recommend targeted learning and training modules to managers on the importance of recognition and how to identify impactful recognition moments.</p>
<p>Predictive and prescriptive analytics can also be highly valuable when gathering Voice of Employee (VoE) insights. Here, employees’ responses to polls and pulse surveys are correlated to outcomes related to employee productivity and satisfaction. Leaders and HR personnel then use the systems’ recommendations on next steps and possible solutions to issues such as how to boost employee sentiment, decrease attrition, and build engagement levels throughout the organization.</p>
<h2>Plans going forward</h2>
<p>Augmenting the R&amp;R platform with newer technologies and introducing more use cases into the solution is critical to the HR transformation journey and to ensure maximum ROI for the enterprise. While the role of the service provider is to build such advanced solutions, enterprises need to update their vision for R&amp;R and accommodate plans for program design and implementation.</p>

Indeed, many companies were questioning the sustainability of their HR strategies during 2020.</p>
<p>During the health crisis, leading organizations found that enabling a technology-driven HR function has been the key to supporting their employees and progressing with business as usual. They are also focusing on building a more sustainable employee experience by acknowledging their needs, rethinking and reconsidering their approach, and, in turn, strengthening their operations. Doing so will help leaders create great places to work.</p>
<p>A key component of this is strengthening their employee rewards and recognition (R&amp;R) programs, which have been proven to improve employees’ alignment with core company values, increase employees’ efficiency, and improve employees’ overall well-being, engagement, and productivity. Moreover, R&amp;R policies that encourage and reward employees for their outstanding performance in today’s ever-demanding environment boost employees’ spirits and confirms that their work is valued and recognized.</p>
<p>Here’s a four-part framework for a modernized R&amp;R strategy that will help enterprises maintain a motivated and satisfied workforce.</p>
<h2>#1 Building a flexible and scalable R&amp;R program</h2>
<p>The coronavirus outbreak has brought about a massive, unprecedented shift in working lifestyle. To maintain operational fluidity, enterprises have adopted new ways of working and updated their HR policies and strategies to be more flexible. And as workforce size fluctuated and rewards budget decreased, the HR managers had to administer the program accordingly, highlighting the need for a scalable and flexible R&amp;R tool.</p>
<p>With most of the workforce working remotely or in a hybrid employment model, enterprises must have an R&amp;R program that can serve such a demographically diverse and emotionally distant workforce and promote a more collaborative and engaging environment. It is crucial that companies adopt a scalable and flexible program that is open to modifications based on rapidly changing requirements and asks of the employer, with minimum effort from HR administrators.</p>
<h2>#2 Understanding, measuring, and increasing engagement</h2>
<p>The challenge of working remotely while managing household pressures and the impersonal way of working during 2020 resulted in burnout and increased stress levels for employees. This could potentially demotivate employees in 2021 and cost enterprises far more due to increased expenditure on psychological and physical benefits. To prevent this from happening, enterprises must recognize employees for achieving their short- and long-term goals.</p>
<p>To better track improvement in employees’ motivation and productivity, and gauge the impact of the R&amp;R program, HR and senior leaders must deploy a method to measure ROI. Leveraging data, AI, and ML systems can be incredibly powerful in forming data-driven analyses and informed insights for the R&amp;R strategy. With data at their fingertips, HR leaders can modernize recognition to make better decisions, control costs, and retain talent.</p>
<h2>#3 Recognizing R&amp;R as a holistic solution for employee experience</h2>
<p>The purpose of an R&amp;R program is to give back to employees for their hard work and dedication. But recognition alone does not serve the purpose. Giving back should also ideally include safeguarding employees’ well-being and development and, hence, cater to physical, emotional, and financial wellness and learning initiatives.</p>
<p>With the HR function redesigning the entire employee journey to fit into a virtual work environment with minimal face-to-face interactions, elements like work-life balance, well-being, connection, and collaboration will be vital to both employee satisfaction and optimized business outcomes.</p>
<p>Enterprises need to revise their approach toward employee experience, with recognition being the central theme for reinforcing practices that improve employee productivity and performance. R&amp;R can also encourage employee participation in well-being and training initiatives.</p>
<h2>#4 Modernizing the rewards platform for a contemporary workforce</h2>
<p>In 2020, there was greater demand for personalized and specially curated rewards catalogs, including work from home essentials, locally sourced items, and special care packages. Redemption options such as donations, charities, and e-vouchers also gained popularity. As the coronavirus vaccine reaches the masses and travel restrictions lift, there will be a greater demand for experiential rewards such as event tickets and leisure activities.</p>
<p>With millennials constituting the majority of the workforce, enterprises have increasingly enabled their rewards platform to deliver an e-commerce website-like experience with features such as filter options, sorting, and wish lists. With the growing gig economy and rising significance of the work from home setup, enterprises should look for a rewards platform that offers a wide range of rewards that can be redeemed across multiple countries and continents.</p>
<p>There is no question that today’s enterprises need to update their HR strategy to effectively address and operate in the new normal. A very large component of that update is how they rethink and revise their R&amp;R activities. Indeed, HR professionals must focus on building an effective R&amp;R plan that is more adaptable, advanced, and progressive; doing so will help set the right path for a new and improved employee experience. The organizations that prioritize their employee and embrace the new normal are bound to reap huge benefits.</p>

If so, you probably didn’t give the same level of effort and thought to your next presentation. Every time an employee&#8217;s work goes unappreciated, they lose motivation. It’s demoralizing to continue putting time into projects without getting any recognition or reward.</p>
<p>Sadly, only <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">46% of employees</a> rate their leaders and managers above average in providing recognition, and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/the-current-state-of-employee-engagement-and-how-to-make-it-better/">59% of employees</a> are not recognized at their preferred frequency. The good news is that companies that use recognition platforms dramatically improve employee morale. These companies are 6 times more likely to give recognition multiple times each month, 36% more likely to see an increase in employee engagement, and 36% more likely have their employees rate their employer brand highly.</p>
<p>To achieve these results, you need to construct your program with specific metrics in mind. This piece explains why recognition is important, outlines the criteria you should consider when launching your program, and suggests key performance indicators to assess your success.</p>
<h2>Starting your recognition program</h2>
<p>Implementing a successful recognition program is no small feat. Several general considerations can help you get your initiative off the ground.</p>
<p>First, make sure your recognition program is geared towards everyone in your organization. Today, only <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">34 percent of companies</a> provide inclusive recognition. Enabling every employee to participate in the program is critical to instituting a true culture of recognition. Recognition should be available to teams, individuals, business units, and locations, without bias. Use a mobile-compatible recognition platform for employees who may be traveling or on the ground at work.</p>
<p>Employees won’t magically start using a recognition platform as soon as you build it. You need to get the word out about your recognition program far in advance. Think about it like a product launch or a new sales strategy: you need an internal promotional strategy, and you must teach people how to engage with it. Many organizations forget the latter. Only <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/2020-state-of-recognition-report">one-third of organizations train</a> individual contributors to recognize, and if training is offered, it’s often offered only once. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/recognition-program-mistake-organizations-are-making/">Training should be frequent</a> and focus on both the importance and quality of recognition. Try to add recognition to onboarding and promotion training to make sure it stays top of mind.</p>
<p>Lastly, remember that <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">what gets recognized gets repeated</a>. Connect recognition with your values and mission so your employees can make the link between their positive actions and your company’s overarching vision. When employees see their peers getting rewarded, they’ll start changing their behavior.</p>
<h2>5 criteria for employee recognition</h2>
<p>Before implementing any program, you should outline a set of criteria to help you measure success. Each of the following elements are key to any recognition program. Companies that meet these criteria are set up to establish a true culture of recognition.</p>
<h3>1. Social recognition</h3>
<p>When most people think of a recognition and rewards program, they think of bonuses or other monetary awards. However, social recognition can be even more impactful than monetary recognition. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/social-recognition-what-why-and-how/">Providing social recognition</a> encourages all employees to get involved, enabling more frequent recognition across the organization.</p>
<p>People who are recognized for their good work are far more likely to stay with their employer and be motivated to do good work. In a study by Aptitude Research Partners, employees at companies that emphasized social recognition were twice as likely to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/">improve individual performance</a>. But this wasn’t limited to employee metrics. Besides increasing company morale, social recognition benefits the bottom line. Social recognition is twice as likely to improve NPS scores and f<a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/">our times as likely to improve stock prices</a>.</p>

<h3>2. Points-based rewards</h3>
<p>Points-based rewards piggyback off of social recognition. Each employee is allocated a particular number of points every week, month, or quarter to dole out to colleagues. These points add up over time, and can be redeemed for an award of the receiver’s choice. This naturally leads to more frequent recognition and keeps a company’s budget from skyrocketing. Accruing points also creates excitement among employees and encourages them to find more reasons to appreciate each other.</p>
<p>A points-based system allows employees to tailor rewards to their wants and needs. Rather than forcing employees to get the same gift, you enable them to choose. This underscores the fact that your company cares about each individual’s contribution to the organization and makes rewards more meaningful.</p>
<h3>3. Peer-to-peer recognition</h3>
<p>Peer-to-peer recognition should be the foundation of your recognition program. Frequent recognition between team members is the best way to cultivate a culture of recognition. Peer-to-peer recognition produces a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2020/03/26/recognition-is-essential-now-more-than-ever/#5ee3fcb75c0e">multiplier effect</a>, inspiring even more employees to engage with and recognize others who are reinforcing your culture. </p>
<p>Ongoing peer feedback has a positive impact on an organization. <a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/Documents/SHRM-GloboforceEmployeeRecognition%202018.pdf">HR professionals are more likely to rate their employee recognition program as “good”</a> at organizations where any employee is able to nominate or recognize a peer, compared with those who had supervisors, senior-level executives, or HR give recognition. And Achievers’ 2020 State of Recognition Report found that programs which include recognition between team members are <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/2020-state-of-recognition-report/">more effective than those that do not</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Recognition from leadership</h3>
<p>Employees follow direction from their managers. As such, leadership needs to set a precedent for recognition. Christus Health is a great example of a company that excels at fostering leadership recognition. Christus used Achievers Recognition to ensure their program was adopted by everyone一especially upper management.</p>
<p>With Achievers, Christus began spotlighting top leadership recognizers in their quarterly recognition and rewards, and added a &#8220;recognition by leaders&#8221; list to their platform to gamify leadership participation. Now, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/case-studies/christus-health-customer-success-story/">99% of leaders have activated their kudos! account</a>, and 85% of them are active each month. This behavior trickled down to associates, who had a 2.9% lower turnover rate three months after the campaign. Overall, Christus measured an ROI of nearly 250% for every dollar spent.</p>
<h3>5. Personal and team milestones</h3>
<p>Recognition should be an everyday occurrence, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore the big milestones. Anniversaries, birthdays, team accomplishments, and other achievements should be highlighted as well. These milestones could be personal, like graduating from a program or earning a new certification. Or they could be finishing a team project or meeting departmental goals for the quarter.</p>
<p>Consider using a platform that empowers colleagues to send digital celebration cards, or allows managers to send recognition to their entire team. This makes employees feel as though none of their accomplishments go unnoticed.</p>
<h2>What about awards?</h2>
<p>The criteria above are fantastic guidelines for when and how to recognize employees, but rewarding employees is a significant piece of the recognition puzzle as well. In this day and age, employees no longer stick around for a gold watch or other antiquated gift. They want to be rewarded regularly with thoughtful, significant awards.</p>
<p>Rethinking how you reward your employees helps you transition from years of service awards 一 which are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-awards/">one-size-fits-all and don’t mean much</a> 一 to a true culture of recognition. Give employees a range of options for redeeming their points, from trips to household items and beyond. Gift cards are an excellent and popular way to guarantee employees are satisfied with the reward they pick.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-state-of-recognition-report/">Take a peek under the hood of your peers’ recognition programs to see how yours compares.</a></strong></em></p>
<h2>How to measure criteria for employee recognition</h2>
<p>Tracking your progress is key to running an effective and efficient employee recognition program. Many HR platforms have built-in reporting functionality to show key performance indicators (KPIs) at a glance. Dashboards like the one below show budget utilization, monthly active users, activation rates, and benchmarks in real time. These dashboards can be made visible to any leader, and they can be exported to combine with other organizational reports.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-28521 aligncenter" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Recognition-metrics-1-300x212.png" alt="" width="346" height="266" /><br />
But before you geek out on dashboarding, your company should establish KPIs that reflect the goals of your recognition program. Here are a few examples.</p>
<h3>Participation of leaders vs. individuals</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, peer and leadership recognition are two best practices of a strong recognition program. Measuring the activity of those two groups is a good indicator of recognition health. If activity is low, try a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/recognition-appreciation-ideas-examples/">new internal campaign</a> to reinvigorate the program.</p>
<h3>Team vs. individual recognitions</h3>
<p>Teams and individuals both deserve to be recognized. Having more of one than the other can be a sign that recognition is waning. Host periodic virtual events and post on your intranet to ensure people know that they can recognize teams and individuals alike.</p>
<h3>Top recognizers</h3>
<p>Top recognizers send the most recognitions and reinforce the need to recognize frequently. Try to learn from their activity. Do they send them on certain devices? After certain projects? This can give you ideas for how to promote recognition internally.</p>
<h3>Activation rate</h3>
<p>Activation rate is probably the simplest metric to track. It indicates how many employees have signed up for your recognition program. An activation rate of 100% is ideal, but this takes significant internal marketing and leadership participation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-28523 aligncenter" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Recognition-metrics-2-300x214.png" alt="" width="403" height="287" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Recognition-metrics-2-300x214.png 300w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Recognition-metrics-2-768x548.png 768w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Recognition-metrics-2.png 993w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></p>
<h3>Monthly active users</h3>
<p>Active users are a key measure of adoption. The more active users you have on your platform, the more recognition will take place.</p>
<h3>Top recognized</h3>
<p>Most companies count how many recognitions each person sends, but the number of received recognitions is just as valuable. Received recognition can be in the form of social appreciation, point rewards, or both. See if there are differences between departments, role level, tenure, or even diversity and inclusion demographics to ensure certain groups aren’t being excluded.</p>
<h3>Point redemptions for rewards</h3>
<p>Since you want as much participation as possible, it’s important to know whether or not your rewards appeal to your employees. If few points are redeemed, it could be a sign that you need to change your offerings. Ask early redeemers for feedback. They might have insight as to what rewards could be more enticing.</p>
<h3>Budget utilization</h3>
<p>You are probably operating under a tight budget for your recognition program. Budget utilization shows how much money you’ve spent and how much you have left. Looking at this often can help you adjust your budget throughout the year.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-28519 aligncenter" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Recognition-metrics-3-300x214.png" alt="" width="404" height="308" /></p>
<h3>Benchmarking</h3>
<p>Some platforms have a benchmark measure to show how your company’s program is performing versus others of similar size and scale. Benchmarks are a good gut check to make sure you’re following best practices and are promoting your program enough internally.</p>
<h3>Recognition engagements</h3>
<p>Recognition platforms often have ways to engage with each recognition. Likes and comments are ways employees can bestow additional appreciation. Some platforms even have “boosts” that let users tack extra points onto existing recognitions. Recognition engagements are a good measure of engagement with the program overall.</p>
<h2>Create a culture of recognition with Achievers</h2>
<p>While we’ve outlined some best practices and ways to get started, what matters most is the recognition tool you select. The best recognition platforms provide realtime insights and the ability to integrate with tools employees already use. Most of all, your platform must be built to encourage the frequent and meaningful recognition needed to drive adoption and employee engagement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="email_"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/kellogg-frequent-recognition/" title="Click here to read this blog" target="_blank"><img width="960" height="539" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kellogg-blog-image.png" class="attachment-email-template-image size-email-template-image wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;width:100%!important;height:auto!important;max-width:100%!important;" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kellogg-blog-image.png 960w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kellogg-blog-image-300x168.png 300w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kellogg-blog-image-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></div><br/><p>Coupling their vision to help foster a good and just world with their mission to create better days and a place at the table for everyone through their trusted food brands, Kellogg set out to fuel their global workforce with frequent recognition and a focus on fairness, equity, and inclusivity.</p>
<p>In business over 100 years, and operating across four regions, Kellogg’s global manufacturing footprint spans North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, with a workforce of over 31,000 employees. A company cognizant of inclusivity, Kellogg recognized that as their teams grew domestically and abroad, a disconnect was forming. A company <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-employee-engagement-survey/">survey</a> revealed that only about half of their people felt that they regularly received recognition for a job well done. It had also become a challenge for Kellogg to reach even 5% of their population with any type of monetary recognition outside of their regular compensation and bonuses. Moreover, of the existing recognition practices they did have, many were siloed, and most were top-down, which was out of step with the organization’s values and objectives.</p>
<p>It was clear that they needed a solution to stay united and keep their teams engaged as they continued to grow. Guided by their Deploy for Growth Strategy which is fueled by the belief that their people are their competitive advantage, Kellogg redefined their recognition and rewards program goals with the objective to:</p>
<p>1. Create a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/shift-years-service-awards-culture-recognition/">culture of recognition</a> in which employees feel frequently appreciated for both their big wins and day-to-day successes</p>
<p>2. Increase company pride and employee loyalty by making employees feel valued, ultimately reducing <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/how-to-protect-your-company-from-high-employee-turnover/">attrition</a> and retaining top talent</p>
<p>3. Establish fairness, equity, and <a href="https:/www.achievers.com/blog/diversity-and-inclusion">inclusivity</a> through a global recognition platform that connects Kellogg employees and increases the visibility of their accomplishments</p>
<h2>The differentiators make all the difference</h2>
<p>Following a thorough review of vendors in the market, Kellogg selected Achievers as their recognition platform of choice based on several of Achievers’ key differentiators:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mobile-first employee experience to meets the needs of their diverse and often offline workforce</li>
<li>Technology to excel beyond peer-to-peer recognition and manage of years of service awards, birthday celebrations, results trackers, and more</li>
<li>Detailed reporting capabilities that provide access to data and analytics to measure success</li>
<li>Consolidation of disparate recognition programs into one global platform</li>
<li>Platform customization to align with the brand and link to their company values, competencies, and objectives</li>
<li>A marketplace of rewards without mark-up and a movement away from cash awards</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating a culture hub with Achievers</h2>
<p>Kellogg used a thoughtful approach for their program rollout, first launching to their North American employees in order to establish best practices, then to Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific — a moment that marked the <a href="https://discover.resources.achievers.com/kellogg/iwlnqb2wr-k">union of their global teams</a>.</p>
<p>With their workforce better aligned, and with all employees able to access the platform’s benefits through its mobile capabilities, Kellogg formed a complete <a href="https://discover.resources.achievers.com/kellogg/o2amvbjg6yu">employee engagement hub</a>, creating a one-stop-shop for all things employee engagement, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A channel through which to recognize and reward across the organization</li>
<li>A library of employee resources</li>
<li>Virtual Service Awards cards that make it easier to promote and celebrate milestones</li>
<li>New features such as: their AMEA HR Excellence Award, Birthday Celebrations, Coffee Chats, Check-Ins, surveys, and Announcements.</li>
<li>A medium through which to share timely and important updates and information in real-time with all employees — an added benefit highlighted during the global pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Kellogg’s core values</h2>
<p>Living the K Values <br />
Demonstrating Leadership through Growth Competencies<br />
Strengthening Our Culture <br />
Displaying Functional or Technical Excellence</p>
<h2>The recognition ROI story</h2>
<p>With an average of 74% of employees logging into the program monthly and 95% having activated their account, Kellogg’s program has become an integral part of their culture and has made a real impact on the business.</p>
<p>Since launching their Achievers platform globally, Kellogg has seen a double-digit increase in the number of employees who agree with the survey statement: “I regularly receive appropriate recognition when I do a good job.”</p>
<p>Keeping in lockstep with this positive trajectory, Kellogg’s monthly recognition metrics have consistently outpaced all benchmarks, ranking in the top quartile across Achievers’ enterprise, global and North American benchmarks.</p>
<p>Other recognition fast facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average employee globally at Kellogg receives 2.6 recognitions per month. This is even higher in the North America region, at 3.3</li>
<li>Globally, 70% of employees at Kellogg receive at least one recognition per month. In North America, 82% of employees do</li>
<li>50% of Kellogg employees send at least one recognition per month. Again, this is even higher in North America at 70%</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s the reason for greater recognition frequency in North America? This region’s commitment to the organization’s recognition best practices, which includes monthly recognition budgets and giving points to all employees to award in peer-to-peer recognition.</p>
<h2>What’s the future of more frequent recognition hold for Kellogg?</h2>
<p>In partnership with Achievers, Kellogg continues to focus on innovative ways to drive engagement and is committed to being an early adopter of new recognition and employee engagement technology. Kellogg intends to reinforce the program’s value as an engagement hub by adding even more initiatives, such as: new wellness and total health programs, employee referral resources, rewards for contributing cost-saving ideas, and other innovations to engage their workforce — all while keeping recognition at the center of what they do.</p>
<p>And with great excitement, Kellogg has plans to roll out Achievers to additional populations and is thrilled about the possibilities that this connectivity will bring to their global workforce.</p>

Or perhaps you received a trophy that sat on your desk, collecting dust. These empty forms of recognition fail to show true appreciation or motivate continued excellence, and you likely thought about leaving as a result.</p>
<p>To retain and engage employees, provide them with meaningful recognition for their years of service — and the dedication those years demonstrate. Effective years of service awards convince employees to give their all for years to come.</p>
<h2>Why years of service awards?</h2>
<p>Employees spend <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/09/welcome-to-the-72-hour-work-we">most of their waking hours at work</a>. Rewarding them for their investment of time and effort drives performance and bolsters retention. Years of service awards are especially useful in keeping employees engaged and loyal. Here are just some of the benefits of instituting a years of service awards initiative at your organization — preferably as part of a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-program">comprehensive recognition program</a>.</p>
<h3>Boost key employee metrics</h3>
<p>At a time when <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/work-and-the-loneliness-epidemic">loneliness at work is at an all-time high</a>, cultivating a sense of belonging among employees is paramount. Years of service awards should be objective, recognizing every employee for their contributions — no matter their role or location. When executed well, years of service awards foster feelings of appreciation and connection. Showing your employees they are truly valued boosts engagement and encourages employees to stay for the long haul. What is more, years of service awards can potentially provide <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/achievement-awards-still-allowed-under-tax-act.aspx">tax benefits</a> to companies whose programs comply with the relevant requirements.</p>
<h3>Create a culture of longevity and loyalty</h3>
<p>Relying on compensation to keep employees around is naïve. A startling <a href="https://info.workinstitute.com/hubfs/2019%20Retention%20Report/Work%20Institute%202019%20Retention%20Report%20final-1.pdf">38% of employees leave in their first year</a>, and 78% leave within five years. HR departments need to make every effort to keep good talent. Part of that strategy should focus on recognizing employees. Years of service awards are an easy way to ensure your employees are rewarded for everything they’ve brought to the company. Consistent, genuine recognition makes people want to stay and keep contributing to your organization’s success.</p>
<h3>Employees expect it</h3>
<p>Ignoring major events disheartens and demotivates employees. And just recognizing that they filled a seat at your company for a certain number of years without acknowledging any of their specific wins during that time is just as demoralizing. Employees expect you to recognize their accomplishments in personalized ways. Recognizing dedication along with an employees’ closed sales, their new certifications, or their outstanding customer service makes the award truly meaningful.</p>
<h3>Demonstrate company values</h3>
<p>Years of service awards present an opportunity to highlight your company values. Recognizing employees who demonstrate company values year over year urges others to emulate their actions and hit the same milestones. Tying your company values to recognition solidifies their significance in your company. This shapes the culture of your organization, reinforcing the good behavior of all employees.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-state-of-recognition-report/">Take a peek under the hood of your peers’ recognition programs to see how yours compares in this one-of-a-kind report.</a></em></strong></p>
<h2>Ideas for years of service awards</h2>
<p>Years of service awards can take many forms. To make things easier for you, here are five ideas that are relatively simple to implement. Of course, these ideas are not exclusive. Depending on your budget and the occasion, you could do them all!</p>
<h3>Reward points</h3>
<p>Rather than giving everyone the same gold watch, consider supplementing your service awards with a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-rewards-ideas/">points-based reward system</a>. Every month, employees can give and receive points for acts of kindness or jobs well done. When points hit a certain balance, employees can redeem them for rewards of their choice. You can offer additional points to recognize milestones and connect them to specific employee accomplishments, which helps individualize your awards.</p>
<h3>Experiences</h3>
<p>Who doesn’t want an extra vacation or a seat at a coveted concert? Many companies now offer experiential rewards like trips or events as part of their years of service program. Experiences spark joy and add another layer of uniqueness to your rewards. Employees will associate the positive emotions from their experience with your company, and they’ll be excited to hit future milestones.</p>
<h3>Ceremonies</h3>
<p>Presenting a service award in a ceremony or during an all-hands meeting broadcasts service awards to everyone in the organization. This level of recognition gives weight to the award and makes other employees watching want to receive the same distinction one day.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, be sure to highlight each recipient’s specific achievements and how they had an impact on the company. Having someone in a leadership position bestow the award and individually thank each awardee makes the presentation even more special. Once the ceremony is over, throw a party — whether at work, a nearby restaurant, or virtually. You can invite coworkers, friends, and family to make the celebration inclusive.</p>
<h3>Handwritten messages of thanks</h3>
<p>Have you ever saved a thank you card? You’re not alone. The Harvard Business Review found that <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/05/recognizing-employees-is-the-simplest-way-to-improve-morale.html">76% of people save handwritten thank you notes</a>. Sending a heartfelt, personalized message can move people to tears. By contrast, using a template is obvious and disingenuous. Show how much impact a person has had on your organization by including a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/recognition-letter/">letter of recognition</a> with a years of service award. Be sure to emphasize what has made employees an extraordinary asset instead of just recognizing their tenure.</p>
<h3>Donations to favorite charities</h3>
<p>Employees have a life outside of work. Many of them donate their free time to charities that hold a special place in their hearts. So what better way to recognize an employee than with a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/10-fun-ideas-celebrating-work-anniversaries/">donation to a cause they care deeply about</a>? Ask the award recipient’s department, family, or friends for tips on where to donate, and commemorate the employee’s milestone by contributing to that nonprofit. Donating to a worthy cause demonstrates that you care about what the recipient cares about, and it adds an altruistic element to your culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/recognition-culture-the-mvp-of-employee-experience/"><em><strong>Find out why a culture of recognition is the MVP of employee experience.</strong></em></a></p>
<h2>How to make years of service awards matter</h2>
<p>It’s not enough to choose a few ideas to implement and never revisit your years of service awards. Employee needs and expectations are always changing. Taking the time to adapt awards to each individual and rewarding people for specific actions in addition to the number of years under their belt helps your awards stand the test of time. Keep these best practices in mind when evaluating and iterating on your awards process.</p>
<h3>Get everyone involved with a reward and recognition platform</h3>
<p>The majority of employees (69%) <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-culture-report/">cite reward and recognition (R&amp;R) programs</a> as motivation to stay at their current job. Companies with a culture of recognition are also twice as likely to see increased employee engagement. And organizations that enable frequent, real-time recognition are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">41% more likely to see increased employee retention</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than solely relying on HR to provide shoutouts to employees at various stages of their career, R&amp;R platforms allow all team members to get in on the recognition action. Coworkers, managers, and executives can show their appreciation for others directly — at any point in time. This leads to a self-sustaining cycle of recognition, spreading its benefits throughout your company.</p>
<h3>Leaders need to show they care</h3>
<p>Imagine receiving a letter of recognition from your company’s CEO. According to Deloitte, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/time-to-rethink-employee-recognition-strategy.html/">44% of employees value recognition from higher levels of leadership the most</a>. Your leaders need to be the biggest advocates for a culture of recognition</p>
<p>Be sure to have managers and executives present at ceremonies, sign letters, and mention the achievements of others at all-hands meetings. Train your leaders and equip them with the resources to provide a great recognition experience. You should also look for tools that automatically remind managers when a direct report’s anniversary is approaching and make it easy for them to show recognition for a team member’s successes at any time.</p>
<h3>Celebrate milestones beyond years of service</h3>
<p>Simply coming to work for 1, 5, or 10 years in a row isn’t what years of service awards should stand for. Being promoted, bringing in a big account, or passing a certification test are all huge achievements. Celebrating these major wins in addition to recognizing employees for small wins establishes a habit of recognition across your organization. To accompany your service awards, publicize employee accomplishments using internal social channels, your company intranet, newsletters, and other avenues.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">Discover the impact inclusive and frequent recognition can have on your business.</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Tailor the award to the person — and the occasion</h3>
<p>Again, personalization should be top of mind when designing awards. This means tailoring the award to the recipient and providing a reward appropriate to the milestone being celebrated. Take into account the number of years an employee has been with the company, their position, and other accomplishments.</p>
<p>To make an especially personalized award, contact friends, old bosses, clients, or vendors, and let them submit a note or photo with the award recipient. Turn these submissions <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/4-ideas-for-work-anniversary/">into a video or email</a> to send as part of the years of service award. Involving peers, family members, and other people the employee has worked with can turn an anniversary into a shared celebration that underscores that person’s influence on the company.</p>
<h3>Include incentives as part of your years of service awards</h3>
<p>When creating or revamping your years of service program, think about incorporating incentives besides physical or monetary awards. Additional retirement benefits matching or sabbaticals after a certain number of years are standard at many enterprises. Brainstorm other ways to incentivize employees to stay. Some examples are p<a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-incentive-programs/">rofit sharing, sponsored education, and additional time off</a>. Even having the freedom to pick projects can qualify as an extra incentive.</p>
<h2>Go beyond years of service awards with a culture of recognition</h2>
<p>There’s so much more to showing appreciation than giving an award every few years. Generic gifts and messages don’t convey appreciation for the unique ways your employees have impacted the organization during their tenure. Even when done well, years of service awards need to be part of a comprehensive recognition program to improve loyalty, participation, and performance.</p>

But why wait until one-off celebrations to recognize and appreciate employees?</p>
<p>Especially as many workplaces shift to virtual or hybrid environments, showing employees appreciation is important now more than ever. According to the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-culture-report/">Achievers Workforce Institute’s 2020 Culture Report</a>, they found that one-third (35%) of respondents picked recognition as their first ask when polled on how their organization could better support them through the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>This Employee Appreciation Day (March 5th, 2021), why not make the extra effort to ensure employees feel appreciated not only on this day but every day after it? The benefits on employee motivation and engagement are immense—<a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/">recognition</a> is consistently identified as having the greatest impact on employee engagement.</p>
<p>Here are 3 ways to start making recognition an everyday event:</p>
<h2>1. Use momentum from one-time events to start recognizing employees better</h2>
<p>A single event can feel hollow without more consistent appreciation throughout the year. Rather, use celebrations like Employee Appreciation Day as a springboard to kickstart a culture that positively reinforces high participation. A good place to start is by asking employees for their feedback, which can guide the type and timing of the recognition they would like to receive.</p>
<h2>2. Increase your recognition frequency</h2>
<p>Research suggests it takes, on average, two months to form a new habit. For many organizations, that means it will be take some practice to make recognizing and showing appreciation a regular practice. However, for recognition to really stick, it needs to start at the top. Managers account for 70% of the variance in employee engagement, with recognition playing a key role.</p>
<h2>3. Make recognition part of who you are</h2>
<p>There are two parts that work together to make recognition self-sustaining. First, making recognition a part of the culture by integrating recognition into organization-wide norms. Second, lean on technology to speed up adoption and track your results. Make sure when considering a recognition technology that it is compatible with your overall goals.</p>
<p>As you have learned, one-off celebrations are important but will not drive consistent recognition. What does drive consistent recognition is a plan and commitment to your employees that they are worth celebrating every day.</p>

<p>Every employee at your organization has their own story, a unique journey that has shaped them and affected your company in turn.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="email_"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-life-cycle/" title="Click here to read this blog" target="_blank"><img width="960" height="540" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iStock-1170045548.jpg" class="attachment-email-template-image size-email-template-image wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;width:100%!important;height:auto!important;max-width:100%!important;" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iStock-1170045548.jpg 960w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iStock-1170045548-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iStock-1170045548-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></div><br/><p>Every employee at your organization has their own story, a unique journey that has shaped them and affected your company in turn. Understanding these journeys — and how your organization can transform them for the better — is one of HR’s most important responsibilities.</p>
<p>Fortunately, while each employee’s experience is personal, they also have some key similarities. Every story will involve how the employee heard about your organization, how they were recruited and onboarded, why they’ve stayed with your company, and how their time at your organization has changed them. These similarities form the basis of the employee life cycle — a model for understanding the employee experience and boosting engagement across each stage of the employee journey.</p>
<h2>What is the employee life cycle — and why does it matter?</h2>
<p>The employee life cycle is a framework that HR can use to view the steps employees progress through during their time with an organization. Generally composed of 5 to 6 stages encompassing initial attraction to eventual separation, the employee life cycle model is an excellent tool for solidifying HR’s grasp on how employees engage with their employers at different points in their career trajectory.</p>
<p>HR professionals can use the employee life cycle to ensure team members are consistently engaged and perform at their best. By viewing the employee experience through a holistic, connected lens, they can better determine where their efforts will make the greatest impact, whether that’s overhauling your organization’s onboarding process or reshaping its culture and brand to attract the best talent</p>
<p>The employee life cycle lets HR view the employee experience with the same discerning eye as marketing professionals dissect the customer experience. A customer journey map provides guidance for taking prospects through the funnel from their first interaction with a brand to conversion and beyond, revealing areas where customers drop out of the process and how to address them. Similarly, closely analyzing the employee life cycle shows what factors are negatively affecting the employee experience and how to best engage your entire workforce.</p>
<h3>Employee life cycle surveys</h3>
<p>The factors that lead to employee engagement are unique for every team member, and they change over time, so you need a way to survey employees at every stage of their journey. With employee life cycle surveys, you can do exactly that. Life cycle surveys provide insight into how employees feel about your company at the key moments of their experience, whether they’ve just been hired, received a promotion, or decided to leave.</p>
<p>With an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">employee engagement solution</a> that keeps all responses fully anonymized and confidential, your team members will share how they honestly feel about your company. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">HR and managers can then use this data</a> to both boost employee engagement at your organization and better craft your brand’s image to attract the talent you need.</p>
<h2>The 6 stages of the employee life cycle</h2>
<p>Each stage of the employee life cycle is a critical part of a team member’s journey at your organization. Here’s a primer on all 6 stages, including how you can improve each and what questions related to each you should ask on your own employee life cycle survey.</p>
<h3>Attraction</h3>
<p>An employee’s journey with your organization doesn’t start with the recruitment process. It begins with the first time they hear about your brand. The best employees won’t join a company that doesn’t represent the very best itself. The power of employer brand is very real: <a href="https://leftronic.com/employer-branding-statistics/">55% of job seekers</a> will stop applying after reading negative reviews about a company, and a staggering <a href="https://medium.com/hr-blog-resources/top-6-employer-branding-statistics-for-2020-4e7445d935c0">92% of individuals</a> would consider leaving their current job for an opportunity with a company that has a great reputation.</p>
<p>How can you start making your organization somewhere the top talent wants to be? Following these practices is a great start.</p>
<h4>Build a culture of recognition</h4>
<p>There are few things employees value more than feeling appreciated. Think back to the last time you received recognition at work. Whether it was from a peer, manager, or even a member of your organization’s leadership team, it stuck with you, didn’t it? It’s no surprise that <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/">recognition has the greatest impact on employee engagement</a> and organizations that rate their culture of recognition highly are 79% more likely to rate their employer brand highly as well.</p>
<p>Saying “thank you” every so often isn’t going to entice employees to join your company, though. You need to make recognition a part of every team member’s daily experience to build a reputation as an organization that values all employees.</p>
<p>Start by encouraging frequent social and monetary recognition, preferably by adopting an employee recognition platform that’s easy for everyone to use. Organizations that practice recognition frequently are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">41% more likely to see improved employee retention</a> and 34% more likely to see employee engagement. Encourage team members at all levels, from staff to leadership, to get involved as well. Recognition programs that include a peer-to-peer component are <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-state-of-recognition-report/">more effective than those that don’t</a>. And employees <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236441/employee-recognition-low-cost-high-impact.aspx">remember recognition from managers and other leaders best</a>.</p>
<p>While all team members can provide social recognition, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-rewards-ideas/">monetary recognition</a> is often the sole domain of HR and leadership. However, you can get every employee involved by adopting a platform with a points-based reward system. Team members can award each other points that they can then redeem for rewards in your platform’s catalog. From gift cards to unforgettable experiences to items they’ve always wanted, employees will love selecting rewards that are meaningful to them — and word of your company’s amazing recognition system will draw in more great talent.</p>
<h4>Offer great incentives</h4>
<p>Recognition is an incredibly powerful tool, but you need to complement it with <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-incentive-programs/">equally attractive incentives</a>. These range from the obvious — like compensation, health insurance, and retirement benefits — to incentives you may not have thought of. For example, profit sharing, tuition reimbursement, and even additional flexibility in when employees work and what they work on are all great ways to incentivize candidates to join your company — and to motivate your current workforce.</p>
<h4>Find out what employees love about your company</h4>
<p>It’s hard to sell potential candidates on your organization if you’re not sure why your employees have stuck with it. Once you find out what engages your employees, you’ll be able to double down on it and showcase it to the world. Use an engagement platform with employee life cycle surveys to regularly collect this information from all team members. In the surveys, ask what initially attracted employees to your organization, what they like best about it, and what they think could be improved to enhance their experience.</p>
<h4>Market your brand</h4>
<p>None of the practices above will matter if you don’t let people outside your organization know about them, so marketing your employer brand is a must. You should start by developing your corporate website and social media presence. This will be many potential candidates’ first introduction to your company, and a poor user experience can sour what would otherwise be a long, productive relationship. Ensure that your online channels are professional and highlight why your organization is an amazing place to work. Engaging in digital marketing efforts, like promoting your brand on social media and communicating with your target candidates on the platforms they favor, is another excellent way to establish your brand as one employees want to join.</p>
<h3>Recruitment</h3>
<p>The recruitment process isn’t just about evaluating and selecting candidates. It’s also a chance for candidates to get a closer look at your company and decide whether it’s a good fit for them. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/business-case-culture-alignment/">Hiring employees who align with your culture</a> can positively impact all subsequent stages of the employee life cycle. Try the tips below to develop a winning recruitment process that brings in the right people.</p>
<h4>Prioritize diversity when hiring.</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/diversity-and-inclusion/">Developing a diverse workforce has many benefits</a>. Diverse companies see a <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/how-diverse-leadership-teams-boost-innovation">higher bottom line</a>, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3979855/how-hcm-technologies-can-scale-inclusion-in-the-workplac">better employee performance</a>, and even <a href="http://joshbersin.com/2015/12/why-diversity-and-inclusion-will-be-a-top-priority-for-2016/">higher cash flow per employee</a>.</p>
<p>Building a diverse workforce starts with recruiting diverse candidates. To <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/7-strategies-hire-diversity-thought-organization/">prioritize diversity and inclusion when hiring</a>, take steps to avoid any bias during the interview process. You can establish diverse groups of interviewers and train them on how to counteract their own unconscious bias, in addition to subjects that they must avoid during interviews. You should also avoid limiting yourself to only a few recruiting avenues. Instead, educate yourself on all the channels today’s diverse workforce uses, and then use them to engage with potential candidates. Finally, ask questions that reveal diversity of thought in your candidates and prioritize incorporating new perspectives to keep your organization fresh and vital.</p>
<h4>Adapt your process for remote recruiting.</h4>
<p>Many organizations have already moved most or all of their recruitment process online, but <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/recruiting-remote-workers/">hiring remote employees</a> involves far more than simply adopting the required technology. Employees have varying assumptions when it comes to how remote work functions, so be direct on where, when, and how they’ll be expected to work. Keep the hiring process as communal as possible by including additional team members in virtual interviews. And ensure that you’ve kept your process as thorough as it would be if you were recruiting in person, as bringing in the right people is just as important as ever.</p>
<h4>Improve recruitment with employee life cycle surveys.</h4>
<p>Employee life cycle surveys help your organization fine tune its recruitment process. Ask new hires what they loved about their hiring experience and what could be improved. You can also take their temperature on a variety of key engagement factors and then see how their feelings change over time, giving you valuable insight into how your organization affects new hires.</p>
<h3>Onboarding</h3>
<p>Onboarding is that crucial step after recruitment encompassing everything needed to turn your candidate into a high-performing, acclimated employee. Communicating the nuances of the employee’s new position, handling administrative tasks, introducing them to your organizational culture — <a href="https://www.achievers.com/workforce-institute/successful-onboarding/">onboarding involves a lot, and it’s not easy</a>. But it can make the difference between a successful team member and one who struggles and eventually departs early.</p>
<p>Follow these principles when onboarding new employees and you’ll have mastered this part of the employee life cycle.</p>
<h4>Make it a continuous process</h4>
<p>Onboarding shouldn’t come to a stop after two weeks or a month. While this will likely be the most intense phase of onboarding, imposing any sort of hard stop to the onboarding process leaves employees feeling adrift. Instead, build in aspects of onboarding that continue for at least the first year the new employee is with your organization, like regular check-ins and training refreshers or updates. Maintaining this connection will keep employees on track and engaged for the initial stage of their employment and beyond.</p>
<h4>Incorporate coaching</h4>
<p>Having a coach or mentor can make all the difference for employees just joining your organization. Whether it’s a manager or simply a more experienced peer, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/managers-as-coaches/">a coach is there to encourage, guide, and support during both good times and bad</a>. So set up a formal coaching program and watch the relationships between your new employees and veterans grow.</p>
<h4>Clearly define the employee’s role</h4>
<p>It may seem obvious, but if an employee doesn’t know exactly what their role entails, they’re not going to succeed at your company. Poorly crafted job descriptions — or failing to unambiguously communicate the expectations and responsibilities of the new employee — will lead to confusion and frustration. Carefully discuss and demonstrate everything related to the employee’s position, and encourage the employee to ask questions early and often to clarify anything they don’t understand.</p>
<h4>Include employees beyond new hires</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/four-people-forgot-onboarding-program/">Onboarding isn’t just for new hires</a>. Many transitions within your organization call for onboarding, and neglecting these employees can leave them feeling lost and unable to adjust. Employees coming back from parental or medical leave, transitioning from part-time to full-time, or even rejoining the company after a stint elsewhere need help getting up to speed and reorienting themselves.</p>
<h3>Retention</h3>
<p>The challenge of retaining an employee begins as soon as they are hired. It’s on your organization to earn your team members’ trust and prove that it deserves their continued loyalty day in and day out. Thankfully, many of the best ways to boost employee retention are the same as those your organization should already be prioritizing to attract and recruit talent. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/3-employee-retention-best-practices/">Practicing recognition</a>, developing a winning culture, and focusing on the quality of team leaders are all <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/2020-engagement-retention-report/">effective ways to boost retention</a>.</p>
<p>And of course, asking the right questions in your employee life cycle survey is important as well. You can measure your progress on retention by asking employees whether they see themselves at your organization in five years or whether they’d recommend your company to a friend seeking work. You can also get data on the retention factors discussed above through employee life cycle and<a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/"> pulse surveys</a> to see whether you’re successfully prioritizing the things that drive retention at your business.</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>The development stage of the employee life cycle includes everything that helps your employees mature within your organization, from advancing in their career to learning new skills. This is the part of the employee life cycle that can take your organization to new heights. Professional development is a win-win, empowering your team members to achieve things they never thought possible while fostering a workforce that delivers for your customers every time.</p>
<p>Developing your workforce affects every other part of the employee life cycle as well. Your employees are far more likely to remain with your company if it tangibly demonstrates its investment in them, and every employee wants to join an organization that supports their growth. Even employees who decide to move on from your business will always remember what you did to help them on their way, and they’ll look to repay the favor however they can.</p>
<p>Workforce development begins with a continuous learning approach that views each day and task as a chance to improve a skill or discover something new. Empower employees to pursue development opportunities, whether that takes the form of reimbursement for a seminar or covering the cost of tuition for an advanced degree. You should also <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/3-ways-promote-professional-growth/">encourage knowledge sharing</a> within your organization through coaching and regular meetings where employees can share their hard won experiences. And providing recognition to those who achieve their development goals will keep your employees motivated to learn.</p>
<p>You should also <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/5-ways-to-engage-employees-through-learning-and-development/">consider adopting helpful technology like a learning management system (LMS)</a> — a platform that facilitates the management and delivery of online training materials in a variety of formats. It allows your employees to access it from anywhere and pursue development wherever and whenever makes sense for them. Your organization can then track their progress and analyze whether your development objectives are being met. An LMS also provides for an individualized learning experience, allowing you to customize courses and even set up learning paths to help employees learn as they prefer.</p>
<h3>Separation</h3>
<p>Your organization should do everything it can to ensure valued employees will stay with your organization until retirement. But many will, for one reason or another, decide to continue their careers elsewhere at some point.</p>
<p>However, an employee’s departure doesn’t have to be a negative experience. Instead, view it as a learning opportunity — and a chance to turn your former employee into a lifelong advocate for your company. Change your perspective and start treating the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/rethinking-employee-offboarding/">goal of the offboarding process</a> as helping the employee take the next steps of their career journey with dignity and confidence. You’ll find that this approach will pay regular dividends for your organization for years to come. And the data you gain from surveying departing team members will help you keep optimizing the entirety of the employee life cycle.</p>
<h2>Taking control of the employee life cycle</h2>
<p>The employee life cycle is an amazing tool, but trying to get a grasp on each stage can be overwhelming. Thankfully, there are solutions available to assist HR and managers in improving the employee experience.</p>
<p>It all starts with listening to your employees and acting on their feedback. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/listen/">Achievers Listen</a><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is an always-on, flexible voice of the employee solution that’s focused on action. Grounded in workforce and data science, the Listen suite leverages employee feedback at each moment of an employee’s journey inside the organization to give senior leaders deep visibility into their organization’s health, HR professionals the insight to see problems and opportunities, and leads managers to take real-time action.</p>
<p>After you’ve got a grasp on the employee life cycle at your company, you’ll want to start impacting it for the better, and recognition is the best way to positively affect every stage. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/platform/recognize/">Achievers Recognize</a>, an award-winning employee recognition platform, makes showing appreciation to others a seamless, enjoyable part of the everyday work experience. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">Customers who use Achievers Recognize are</a>:</p>

It takes place on the first Friday of March every year, and it’s a great opportunity to show your employees how much you value them. When employees feel appreciated, they perform at their best and are less likely to leave. In fact, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/the-business-impact-of-inclusive-and-frequent-recognition/">organizations that rate their culture of recognition highly</a> are 3 times more likely to see increased employee retention and 2.5 times more likely to see increased employee engagement, among other benefits.</p>
<p>There’s no better time than employee appreciation day to start putting ideas for year-round recognition into practice. Employees will never forget the employee appreciation day when they first started to accrue reward points, or when they first started hearing “thank you” regularly from their manager.</p>
<p>Here are 15 ways you can thrill your employees and keep them motivated on employee appreciation day and beyond.</p>
<h2>For employee appreciation day&#8230;</h2>
<p>Employee appreciation day is the time to provide your team members with something special. Here are a few ideas that are bound to please everyone at your organization.</p>
<h3>1. Reward with gift cards and experiences</h3>
<p>Gift cards are popular for a reason. They give employees the ability to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-rewards-ideas/">choose rewards that they find meaningful</a>, rather than yet another one-size-fits-all t-shirt or water bottle. And if you’re looking for a reward that’s more unique, you can’t go wrong with providing an exceptional experience. This might be something for the whole team — like renting out a theme park, reserving an escape room, or learning to cook from an accomplished chef — or for individual employees, like paying for a day trip to a spa or a meal at their favorite restaurant.</p>
<h3>2. Pamper your employees</h3>
<p>Employee appreciation day is your chance to let your team indulge and take a break from their hard work. Hire a manicurist, masseuse, or chiropractor to come to the office. Having a sleep or mindfulness coach teach your employees tips to lower their stress is another winning option. These activities emphasize your organization’s commitment to employee wellness and help everyone feel relaxed and rejuvenated.</p>
<h3>3. Donate to your employees’ favorite charities</h3>
<p>Giving to charities employees support shows that you care about what they care about. You can donate to organizations in employees’ names or provide employees with a set amount to donate per month, per quarter, or per year. Matching donations is another possibility. And if you’ve <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/how-to-select-a-recognition-and-rewards-solution-to-boost-employee-motivation-and-engagement/">implemented an employee recognition solution with points-based rewards</a>, you can let them donate reward points to charities of their choice.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-28463 aligncenter" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Employee-appreciation-1-300x207.png" alt="A pink gift box with gold ribbon and glitter scattered over it" width="486" height="335" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Employee-appreciation-1-300x207.png 300w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Employee-appreciation-1-768x531.png 768w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Employee-appreciation-1.png 939w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /> </p>
<h3>4. Give out fun awards</h3>
<p>Remember superlatives at the end of a school year? Everyone anxiously awaited that day, and it’s no different in the workplace. Get creative and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition-awards/">make up some awards people will truly treasure</a>, like recognition master, exceptional listener, and coaching champion. You can also focus on employees who have best demonstrated your core values, made your workplace more inclusive, or acted like a true team player. Awards are specific and tangible, making employees feel uniquely recognized.</p>
<h3>5. Treat your team’s taste buds</h3>
<p>Who doesn’t love a free lunch? Food is one of the simplest and most effective ways to reward your employees. Consider catering a meal, surprising your team with a box of tasty snacks — even if they work from home — or taking folks out for coffee. You can also encourage wellness at the same time by providing delicious healthy treats or taking an outing to a restaurant that provides healthy options.</p>
<h3>6. Enjoy activities in-office or remotely</h3>
<p>Employees want to spend time having fun with their teammates. Host a pizza party in the breakroom or common area with plenty of board games. You could also set up a photo booth, company-wide jeopardy game, or talent contest. And <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/virtual-team-building-activities-for-remote-teams/">if your workforce is primarily remote</a>, set up an afternoon of virtual games and fun, complete with a pre-delivered gift package.</p>
<h3>7. Let employees pursue their passions</h3>
<p>Work shouldn’t consume your employees’ lives. They should have the time and space to pursue their passions and interests outside of the workplace. This could mean volunteering or working on an independent project. Many organizations set aside employee appreciation day for activities their team members have always wanted to try. Besides giving employees a break from work, hobbies can inspire innovative ideas and teach employees new skills that help your organization in the long run.</p>
<h2>&#8230;and beyond!</h2>
<p>The best employee appreciation days mark the start of something bigger and longer lasting. Making a once-a-year splash is great, but starting on the path to a true culture of recognition is something that will impact employees the most. Try out the following ideas on employee appreciation day and afterwards to make recognition a key part of the employee experience.</p>
<h3>8. Just say “thank you”</h3>
<p>Simply saying “thank you” can have an enormous impact on your employees, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/analyst-insight/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/">boosting everything from productivity to retention to engagement</a>. Get your workforce in the habit of<a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition/"> recognizing people frequently and in real time</a>, and soon every day will feel like employee appreciation day. Have leadership take part in this initiative — <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/319355/remote-workplace-needs-recognition-rituals.aspx">recognition from managers and executives means the most to employees</a> — and you’ll have created an employee appreciation day with a profound, enduring impact.</p>
<p>To make appreciation easy in this era of remote work, look for recognition tools that integrate with the ways you communicate daily, whether that’s Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, or another platform. For instance, your organization could adopt a plugin that, upon conclusion of a virtual meeting, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/press/achievers-launches-a-zoom-integration-that-enables-virtual-meeting-recognitions-in-the-flow-of-work/">prompts employees to recognize other participants and even provides fun messages and graphics for doing so</a>. And if it automatically links with your recognition platform, giving employees the option to reward others with redeemable points, so much the better.</p>
<p>For a more personal touch, have team members’ <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/20-fresh-ideas-best-employee-appreciation-week-ever/">handwrite thank you notes</a>. The time and thought that comes with each note goes a long way towards making the recipient feel valued.</p>
<h3>9. Recognize major milestones and small victories</h3>
<p>Big achievements like hitting sales quotas, launching a new product, or retaining tough clients are all reasons to celebrate. Employees expect to be recognized and rewarded for successfully executing on major undertakings. However, practicing more frequent recognition for smaller victories can be unexpected, delightful pick-me-ups for your employees. Be sure to balance your appreciation for big wins with recognition for the little things as well. Use your website, social media channels, newsletter, company-wide newsfeed, or meetings as forums for practicing recognition on employee appreciation day and year-round.</p>
<h3>10. Start a recognition program</h3>
<p>There’s no better day to announce a recognition program than employee appreciation day. A fully <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">comprehensive recognition and rewards platform</a> reminds people to recognize their peers frequently and genuinely. Your platform’s user interface should be straightforward and integrate with other software your employees already use. In addition, employees should be able to recognize each other anywhere, anytime. A mobile-friendly platform is crucial for companies whose teams are on the ground.</p>
<p>And don’t forget about the rewards. Many businesses opt for a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/recognition-appreciation-ideas-examples/">points-based recognition program</a> to give employees the flexibility to choose their own rewards, reducing administrative overhead and creating a personalized recognition experience.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-28465 aligncenter" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Employee-appreciation-2-300x171.png" alt="" width="546" height="311" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Employee-appreciation-2-300x171.png 300w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Employee-appreciation-2-768x437.png 768w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Employee-appreciation-2.png 938w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" /></p>
<h3>11. Find out how employees want to be appreciated</h3>
<p>Have you ever asked your employees how they’d like to be recognized? <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/what-is-employee-voice-and-why-is-it-important/#:~:text=Employee%20voice%20is%20often%20defined,at%20work%20through%20their%20feedback.">Give your employees a voice</a> by gathering their feedback through<a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/"> pulse surveys</a>, together with <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">always-on feedback channels</a> employees can take advantage of whenever they have something to say. Surveying employees about the forms of recognition they find most meaningful will ensure that your appreciation efforts hit the mark.</p>
<h3>12. Implement employee feedback</h3>
<p>Collecting employee feedback isn’t enough, though — your organization needs to act on it! Making changes employees want to see will give them the confidence that their opinions matter and that your company is willing to adjust. Eventually, this will motivate more employees to participate in your company’s feedback and recognition initiatives.</p>
<h3>13. Support work-life balance</h3>
<p>Team members who are well-rested and have time to spend with their family and friends are more engaged and productive. Letting your employees have a life outside of work is vital to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/burnout-job/">preventing burnout</a>. When possible, compromise with your employees on their schedule. For instance, employees with children may want to arrive and leave early. Others with extracurricular activities may want to come in late, or even transition to a four-day work week. Your organization can also provide additional PTO or occasional unexpected half-days to preserve work-life balance.</p>
<h3>14. Provide time for meditation and mindfulness</h3>
<p>Meditation and mindfulness are the keys to employee wellness. Paychex discovered that stressed employees <a href="https://www.paychex.com/articles/human-resources/work-more-stress-less">found mindfulness to be an essential strategy</a> in overcoming their wellness challenges. Mindfulness can help employees <a href="https://www.gqrgm.com/7-benefits-of-mindfulness-in-the-workplace/">problem solve, absorb new information, adapt to changes, and increase their empathy</a> for others. Start setting aside time during the work day for meditation — or even bring in a trainer — and begin a key wellness practice on employee appreciation day.</p>
<h3>15. Support continuous learning</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/5-ways-to-engage-employees-through-learning-and-development/">Continuous learning</a> is crucial to developing an agile, high-performing workforce. For employee appreciation day, offer paid continuous learning courses related to work or personal interests. Recognize the employees who take advantage of these classes to reinforce the behavior.</p>

The pandemic tested every aspect of maintaining an engaged and connected workplace. While enterprises were concerned about the sustainability of the business, employees were unsure of what to expect next. There was worldwide economic and societal unrest that caused employers to value and appreciate their employees in bolstering their business when many others were forced to shut down.</p>
<p>The challenges in 2020 will have a long-term impact on the way enterprises engage with their employees and follow strategies to deliver a superior employee experience. In fact, enterprises have realized how a simple solution like rewards and recognition (R&amp;R) can prove to be fruitful in making their employees feel valued. And indeed, organizations radically altered their work practices and focused on humanizing the R&amp;R process to revolutionize the way their workers interact.</p>
<p>Though offices around the world will likely start opening when a critical mass of the country’s citizens are vaccinated, remote work will remain relevant, often preferred, and will be an integral part of the decision-making process going forward.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick look at the top five R&amp;R focus areas in 2021.</p>
<h2>Focus area #1</h2>
<h3>Unified platform for employee communication and collaboration</h3>
<p>As teams grew demographically diverse and emotionally distant, it became difficult to remain connected with teammates. The recognition platform played a crucial role in promoting conversations between peers as moments of achievements and celebrations were shared widely through the newsfeed. The R&amp;R platform will continue to serve as a communication platform for sending across relevant company news and announcements to employees. It will also serve as an important tool for HR managers and leaders to roll-out regular polls and provide an open platform for collecting feedback from employees.</p>
<h2>Focus area #2</h2>
<h3>Encouraging diversity &amp; inclusion (D&amp;I) in the workplace</h3>
<p>Though D&amp;I has been a hot topic for some time now, the events in 2020 helped accelerate the adoption of such practices in the workplace. As D&amp;I grows in popularity, recognition solutions will utilize technology to make peers and the platform itself smarter to ensure no unconscious bias exists toward employees, and in the way a token of gratitude is sent. An increasing number of companies will start focusing on D&amp;I based on gender and gender identity, ethnicity and race, religion, sexual orientation, and other social factors, and will instill the same values into the R&amp;R platform. This will also include tracking behaviors within teams through D&amp;I KPIs.</p>
<h2>Focus area #3</h2>
<h3>Collecting feedback through Voice of Employee (VoE)</h3>
<p>Since the onset of the pandemic, employers found it hard to understand how employees were feeling and were unable to track employee engagement and satisfaction in their true sense. Using an employee recognition platform to collect feedback and carry out pulse surveys from time-to-time helped companies develop people-centric strategies to improve overall performance and work quality and promote a healthy work environment. This will enhance the employee experience and workplace culture, increase productivity and efficiency, and refine business processes and outcomes. An advanced VoE solution will also provide actionable insights and suggestions that senior leaders can undertake at the team- or company-wide level.</p>
<h2>Focus area #4</h2>
<h3>Increased emphasis on employees’ health and wellbeing</h3>
<p>The COVID-19 outbreak forced organizations to keenly focus on employee wellbeing and health. While poor work-life balance was undoubtedly one of the key issues, isolation and loneliness highly altered employees’ capacity to work and perform. Issues like mental health, burnout, and stress took a toll on employees and led to a loss in productivity and reduction in quality of the work delivered. Realizing that employees are the real asset, enterprises will continue to embrace solutions that will help better employees’ health and wellbeing. These will include both the mental and physical health of the employee and will leverage technology to connect them with fitness coaches and online counselors.</p>
<h2>Focus area #5</h2>
<h3>Utilizing the power of integrations and open APIs</h3>
<p>As the user base for video conferencing and team collaboration applications such as Google Meets, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom grew, so did demand for the integration of these solutions with R&amp;R platforms. This enabled managers and peers to send recognition in the flow of work and encouraged timely appreciation of great work. It is expected to pave the path to a truly integrated R&amp;R platform with options to integrate with communication tools such as G Suite, Outlook, and Slack, HCM solutions and HRIS systems, and other employee engagement solutions for employee wellness, engagement analytics, etc.</p>
<p>Overall, the sustainability of the R&amp;R program will be the key theme. The ease of accessibility, implementation, and ability to support enterprises and employees during a pandemic will define the capability of the program.</p>
<p>We’re all glad that 2020 and all its uncertainties are behind us. Yet, it proved to be a very valuable experience and impacted our lives in ways that we never expected. The pandemic pushed businesses to adopt a much stronger employee-centric approach and accelerated development plans from a service provider point of view. It also tested the strength of the existing program in serving a demographically spread and physically disconnected workforce. The lessons learned will continue to be a guiding light for product development teams as organizations set new strategies to drive large-scale cultural progress.</p>

You care about people’s needs, and you likely feel best when you’re making a difference in someone’s life. After all, the word &#8220;human&#8221; is right there in your job title! </p>
<p>There’s absolutely nothing wrong with seeing your work in human terms. But the leadership at your company may not be speaking your language. They have their own set of concerns, and if you really want to impress them, you have to present your ideas in a way that they not only understand but also grasp the value of. </p>
<h2>What the C-suite really wants </h2>
<p>What matters most to your CEO? A <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-05-08-gartner-survey-reveals-that-ceo-priorities-are-slowly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Gartner study</a> found that growth is on the minds of most leaders. A full 53 percent named growth as their top priority, and it was the only goal to receive a majority of votes. It’s also worth noting that financial concerns jumped up several percentage points over past years, so it looks like the bottom line is the heart of the matter for most leaders. </p>
<p>With financials and growth taking up executives’ bandwidth, it should be no surprise that the C-suite is focused on numbers. Data matters, and any new proposal is going to be met with a skeptical eye — <i>unless</i> you can prove its value with metrics. The question that savvy HR professionals should be prepared to answer isn’t just &#8220;Can we afford it?&#8221; but &#8220;What will be the Return on Investment (ROI) for this initiative?&#8221; </p>
<p>For executives, ROI is best described in cold, hard numbers. Fortunately, there are lots of studies out there to help you make your case, and you can also build in assessments to track the success of any program you implement. </p>
<p>Best of all, it doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Start with these tips to sell your ideas to your company’s leadership.</p>
<h2>1. Craft enhanced benefits plans designed to retain employees</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/study-turnover-costs-employers-15000-per-worker/449142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A recent study</a> estimates that it costs 33 percent of an employee’s salary to replace them if they leave your company. One way to retain great employees is to make sure your benefits package is competitive in case they go looking for other job. </p>
<p>Which benefits will have the biggest impact? The <a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/Documents/SHRM%20Employee%20Benefits%202019%20Executive%20Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Society for Human Resource Management</a> (SHRM) reports that the top five most valued employee benefits are: </p>
<ol>
<li>Health insurance </li>
<li>Retirement savings plans </li>
<li>Sick leave and vacation time </li>
<li>Flexible work schedules </li>
<li>Professional development opportunities </li>
</ol>
<p>The study also points out that early adopters of enhanced benefits packages have an advantage when it comes to retaining employees. In addition, wellness benefits were shown to decrease absenteeism and increase productivity — information that will help define ROI for the C-suite.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22203" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/09_27_2019_2-1024x582.jpg" alt="employee feedback" width="640" height="364" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/09_27_2019_2-1024x582.jpg 1024w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/09_27_2019_2-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/09_27_2019_2-768x436.jpg 768w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/09_27_2019_2.jpg 1130w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>2. Don’t guess what employees want — ask</h2>
<p>Of course, the best way to ensure that your new initiatives keep workers engaged and happy is to ask them what they want and take action. Company leadership is always going to want to know if your programs are paying off, and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/what-we-offer/listen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gathering employee feedback</a> is a great way to measure results — especially for employee initiatives aimed at improving &#8220;soft&#8221; areas like morale. Take advantage of employee feedback and listening tools to gather insights that will impress your C-suite. </p>
<p>For example, General Motors wanted to engage its global workforce. That’s a big goal that’s not always easy to measure. When they saw over 5,000 positive comments in their engagement survey about their <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/general-motors-customer-success-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GM Recognition Program</a>, they knew with certainty that they were on the right track. Engagement survey results showed substantial improvements in the area of recognition. Just six months after the GM Recognition Program launched, employee recognition became one of the five move improved areas in their engagement survey. This is the type of employee feedback that you want to share with the C-suite &#8211; it will spotlight the impact and value of your work.</p>
<h2>3. Make the case for recognition and rewards</h2>
<p>The GM Recognition Program is a huge success. The company wanted to encourage behaviors that aligned with its new vision, so they chose a points system in which employees could recognize each other for going above and beyond on certain measures. The points system allowed workers to choose the rewards they found most meaningful — an example of the company addressing feedback about what made their previous rewards system unpopular. If you have an employee recognition program in place, it&#8217;s important to measure your recognition program&#8217;s performance frequently (not annually) to get the best ROI to wow the C-suite. For example, within just 30 days of launching the GM Recognition Program, 87 percent of the entire global population was active in the <a href="https://www.achievers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Achievers</a> platform sending over 80,000 unique recognitions. After the first year, GM reached a 97 percent activation rate (against an 80 percent target).  </p>
<p>Why should <i>your</i> leaders care about employee recognition? Because CEOs know that it has the <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/building-a-business-case-for-social-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest impact on employee engagement</a>. Companies with the highest engagement levels are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/reports/191489/q12-meta-analysis-report-2016.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21 percent more profitable</a> than those with the lowest engagement levels, and engagement is also strongly <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/unhappy-employees-unhappy-customers-how-to-break-the-lose-lose-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">correlated with excellent customer service satisfaction</a> scores. In fact, companies that invest in employee recognition are four times more likely to see an increase in stock prices and twice as likely to improve their NPS scores and individual performances. Use this data to make the case that it’s a <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/get-executives-board-employee-rewards-recognition-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matter of real dollars and cents</a> to implement a strong recognition and rewards program. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an HR professional and have a company-wide recognition program in place (or considering one), get a full understanding of <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/recognition-the-ultimate-measure-of-employee-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how recognition is the ultimate measure of employee engagement</a> and communicate your recognition program’s value to the C-suite. Success numbers highlighting how your recognition program has improved key business areas such as engagement scores, customer satisfactions scores, and/or retention rates are gold to the C-suite. If you’re looking for examples of recognition program success stories, access <a href="https://www.achievers.com/customer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Achievers’ case studies</a>. </p>
<h2>4. Choose team building activities with proven results</h2>
<p>Another important way to improve employee engagement and performance is to enhance teamwork within your organization. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5234826/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">major meta-study of team building activities</a> found that lectures were the least effective way to improve team functioning, while experiential activities that got employees using the skills in question were highly effective. The authors also note that activities focused on improving social dynamics among workers are also effective, even if those activities didn’t directly relate to on-the-job &#8220;hard&#8221; skills.  </p>
<p>The upshot? You can make a data-based case for professional development aimed at &#8220;soft&#8221; skills and interpersonal communication. </p>
<p>Team building activities also improves team morale and company culture. Your C-suite can participate in activities and see the positive outcomes of having an engaged team.  </p>
<p><b>Pro tip: </b>Add a quarterly team building event to your company calendar. Take a look at <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/10-fun-games-for-team-building/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our list of fun games for team building</a> to get started. </p>

<p>Engaged employees value more than their paychecks. They’re enthusiastic about their jobs and have a genuine desire to help your organization thrive. It’s no surprise that companies with high employee engagement bring in 21% more profits, while disengaged employees cost organizations in the U.S. up to $550 billion annually. As that last statistic shows, employee [&#8230;]</p>

They’re enthusiastic about their jobs and have a genuine desire to help your organization thrive. It’s no surprise that companies with high employee engagement <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx">bring in 21% more profits</a>, while disengaged employees <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/study-disengaged-employees-can-cost-companies-up-to-550b-a-year/437606/">cost organizations in the U.S. up to $550 billion annually</a>.</p>
<p>As that last statistic shows, employee engagement doesn’t just happen on its own. Organizations need to cultivate it. Here are eight employee engagement strategies that can change your company for the better.</p>
<h2>8 employee engagement strategies that make a difference</h2>
<p>These eight strategies address the most impactful employee engagement factors. Start practicing them, and you’ll be on your way to a more motivated, committed workforce.</p>
<h3>1. Give employees a voice</h3>
<p>Employees want to know that their thoughts and opinions matter. When organizations listen to and act on employee feedback, team members appreciate it, and they’ll invest more of themselves in the company. Employees who believe their voice is heard are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nazbeheshti/2019/01/16/10-timely-statistics-about-the-connection-between-employee-engagement-and-wellness/?sh=5a5f0efb22a0">4.6 times more likely to perform at their best</a>.</p>
<p>There’s no better way to encourage employee voice than through regular <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-questions/">employee engagement surveys</a>. Use a combination of <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-pulse-survey/">pulse surveys</a> — short questionnaires designed to track responses about a certain topic over time — and an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/white-papers/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/">always-on feedback channel</a> to keep track of employee engagement in real time. Find a platform that makes diving into the data easy with features like heat maps, which show areas of weakness and strength at a glance.</p>
<p>To implement this engagement strategy, you should use an <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-software-platforms/">employee engagement solution</a> that empowers managers to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-results-action-plans/">take appropriate action quickly</a>. HR plays a key role in training managers on how to respond to feedback effectively, but it’s up to the managers themselves to act. Your platform should provide each manager with everything they need to work with their team to create a collaborative action plan that everyone buys into.</p>

<h3>2. Recognize and reward all team members</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-recognition/">Employee engagement and employee recognition go hand in hand</a>. And employees who feel appreciated stick around — <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/employee-recognition-and-retention/?zd_source=hrt&amp;zd_campaign=5503&amp;zd_term=chiradeepbasumallick">63% of employees who are recognized at work often</a> are unlikely to look for a new job.</p>
<p>Social recognition, from saying “thank you” in the hallway to providing kudos at a company-wide meeting, can be even more impactful than monetary recognition — when it’s delivered the right way. Employees aren’t engaged by half-hearted gratitude delivered months after the fact. Instead, encourage all team members, from the executive level on down, to provide recognition frequently and in real time. By recognizing employees quickly after the desired behavior, and by clearly linking the recognition to that behavior, you’re <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/2020-engagement-retention-report/">much more likely to see those actions repeated</a>.</p>
<p>You want monetary recognition to be just as easy to provide, so ensure your recognition solution also supports point-based rewards. All team members then receive points they can award to others, who can then redeem them for rewards that they actually want. Engagement requires personalization, and there’s nothing more personal and meaningful than a reward you’ve chosen yourself.</p>
<p>Getting everyone at your organization involved with recognition is much simpler when you have a platform that lets team members provide both social and points-based recognition from anywhere, anytime. The right tool can also make the recognition experience more engaging by letting employees like and comment on specific recognitions, as well as by “boosting” recognitions they find especially meaningful with additional points.</p>
<h3>3. Establish great values — and live by them</h3>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/company-core-value-examples/">company’s core values</a> are its guiding principles and beliefs. Employees crave working for an organization whose values speak to them — the culture and values of an organization are the <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/2020-engagement-retention-report/">biggest contributing factor to employee satisfaction</a>. This makes defining and acting on exceptional company values a winning employee engagement strategy.</p>
<p>Whatever your organization’s values are, you should keep them short, specific, and closely connected to the goals your company wants to achieve. Employees are more likely to connect with values that are understandable and relate to both the company’s internal culture and its effect on the world at large. The best values accurately reflect your culture and show what sets your company apart from its competitors.</p>
<p>After defining your values, ensure that you’re clearly communicating them to employees and that your organization demonstrates those values in everything it does. If employees buy into your company’s values and see your company and its leadership sticking to them, they’ll be motivated to exemplify them in their own work. You should also reward team members for actions that reflect your values, as what gets recognized gets repeated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.achievers.com/resources/webinars/culture-alignment-techniques-that-drive-business-performance/"><em><strong>Discover how to build a value-based culture that drives business performance.</strong></em></a></p>
<h3>4. Prioritize diversity and inclusion</h3>
<p>When you foster a diverse and inclusive environment, all of your employees feel involved and supported, regardless of who they are or what jobs they perform. In a recent survey, <a href="https://whattobecome.com/blog/diversity-in-the-workplace-statistics/">57% of employees stated they hope their company</a> becomes more diverse. And with a variety of viewpoints and perspectives, your company will benefit from greater creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/diversity-and-inclusion/">start encouraging diversity in many ways</a>, from leveraging tools to measure the success of your D&amp;I initiatives to prioritizing diversity during the hiring process. Your organization should do everything it can to <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/psychological-safety-at-work/">establish an environment of psychological safety</a> where employees know that they’re valued for themselves, not just what they do.</p>
<h3>5. Provide great incentives</h3>
<p>There will be times when even the most engaged employees seem less interested or passionate about their work. Maybe they feel a bit burnt out. Or maybe they need an extra push or pick-me-up.</p>
<p>Whatever the situation is, <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/employee-incentive-programs/">great incentives</a> can help. At their core, incentives are rewards that promote hard work and positivity. Research has shown that <a href="https://www.dcrstrategies.com/customer-incentives/customer-retention-business-repeat-customers/">organizations who take advantage of incentive programs have a 79% higher success rate</a> in meeting their goals, provided they offer the right reward.</p>
<p>Since your company has its own unique values, you should select incentives that align with them as well as the desires and interests of your employees. Examples of incentives you may want to consider include referral programs, professional development opportunities, on-site health screenings, bonuses, exciting experiences and other gifts — the list goes on. Survey your employees to find out what incentives they want the most, and tailor your initiatives to match.</p>
<h3>6. Support employee wellness</h3>
<p>The benefits of employee wellness are tremendous. It can lead to fewer absences, lower healthcare costs, and greater productivity. You’ll find that happier and healthier employees are more dedicated to their jobs and outperform those whose physical and mental health is on the back burner. Over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/731721/impact-on-workers-from-company-offered-wellness-programs-in-us/">80% of employers</a> say that their organization’s wellness program has a positive impact on the health of their workers and leads to improved productivity.</p>
<p>If you’d like to implement this employee engagement strategy, start with the basics, like <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/burnout-job/">combating burnout</a> and <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/4-tips-cultivate-mindfulness-work/">encouraging mindfulness</a>. Educate your employees on healthy habits and provide rewards for practicing them with a recognition platform that <a href="https://www.achievers.com/press/achievers-launches-integration-with-wellright-to-streamline-employee-rewards-recognition-and-wellness/">integrates with a wellness solution</a>. Employees can then automatically receive reward points when they achieve their tracked wellness goals, which only provides further motivation to make healthy choices in and out of the workplace.</p>
<h3>7. Foster professional growth</h3>
<p>Engaged employees view their time with your organization as a career, not just a job. It’s essential that you encourage team members to think this way by <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/leverage-learning-development-improve-employee-engagement/">supporting their professional development</a>. When employees see that you’re investing in them and care about their growth, they’ll pay it back by going the extra mile and producing higher quality results. According to one survey, 68% of employe<a href="https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/learning/news/7-stats-that-prove-training-value#:~:text=68%25%20of%20employees%20say%20training,That's%20according%20to%20ClearCompany.&amp;text=Companies%20have%20a%20real%20opportunity,looking%20for%20career%20growth%20opportunities.">es believe training and development is the most important policy in their organization</a>.</p>
<p>So how can you promote professional growth? First and foremost, establish sensible career paths so every employee has a clear route to advancement. Be open to employees taking on new projects and responsibilities that may not be in their job description — cross-training keeps them engaged and teaches them useful skills. You can also organize training sessions in which employees learn new hard or soft skills. And cover the costs of conferences and seminars for employees to help them stay on top of industry trends and changes.</p>
<h3>8. Train leaders on engagement</h3>
<p>Some leaders in your organization may be unaware of the importance of employee engagement or what they can do to promote it. Make the benefits of employee engagement known to your leaders so they understand why it’s so important, and provide them with the training they need to build an engaged workforce. HR needs to connect with every executive and manager to ensure they’re equipped with the knowledge and tools they need to act on employee feedback, show recognition in real time, and do everything else in their power to implement your organization’s employee engagement strategies on a daily basis.</p>

The traditional concept refers to legally mandated benefits plus a few voluntarily added by employers. With a new generation of employees, soon to become the majority of the workforce, and a competitive, global labor market, comes new workforce needs and expectations. Employers are responding with a menu of voluntary employee benefits, driven by generational shifts and technology that is dramatically changing the workplace.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2">What are employee benefits? </h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Employee benefits are non-salary compensation and perks. They consist of government mandated and voluntary indirect and non-cash compensation.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Federal and state mandated benefits include health insurance, worker&#8217;s compensation, unemployment insurance, and required leave time for caring for family and/or personal medical purposes. Health insurance, and family and medical leave, are not required for all businesses. Some states have mandated disability insurance and retirement plan requirements.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What are benefits that are voluntary? These are benefits an employer voluntarily offers employees, and benefits programs are a top employee recruitment, retention, and engagement strategy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The list of benefits in this category began fairly simply with things like dental insurance and life insurance options. Today, the list of voluntary benefits has grown significantly to include things like reward programs, unlimited vacation time, and flexible work schedules. Bottom line is that voluntary benefits are any perk offered to employees that is not mandated by law.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2">Why are employee benefits important? </h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Employee benefits have always been important, but today they have new implications. Employers use benefits to attract top talent, especially in a tight labor market, and to retain employees once hired. They enable smaller companies to compete with larger businesses that may be able to pay higher salaries. Benefits also act as employee engagement tools and support a positive corporate culture. One survey found that</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2018-11-27-More-Than-One-Third-Of-Workers-Would-Pass-On-Perfect-Job-If-Corporate-Culture-Was-Not-A-Fit-Survey-Finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">35 percent of American workers</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">would not accept a position if the corporate culture was not positive, even if the job was ideal.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Millennials have had an enormous impact on the types of benefits offered and with good reason. Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data found that</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/11/millennials-largest-generation-us-labor-force/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">millennials</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">already account for 35 percent of the U.S. labor force with 56 million people working or looking for employment. They will comprise 75 percent of the global workforce by the year 2025, an important fact to know in a globalized labor market.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The question that is frequently asked is</span><span data-contrast="auto">, “</span><span data-contrast="auto">What are employee benefits</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that have meaning for millennial employees?</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Some involve money, but many don&#8217;t. Numerous employee surveys and research projects, including by </span><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/248009/millennials-good-business.aspx?g_source=link_WWWV9&amp;g_medium=TOPIC&amp;g_campaign=item_&amp;g_content=What%2520Millennials%2520Want%2520Is%2520Good%2520for%2520Your%2520Business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Gallup</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, have discovered millennials want meaningful work and benefits like </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/millennials-and-their-desire-for-always-on-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">always-on feedback</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Millennials also want opportunities to develop strengths and skills, pursue career growth, enjoy work-life balance, and work remotely. These needs and expectations drive the benefits companies are offering.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23985" src="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clayton-cardinalli-GwOqUzrDSRM-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="what are employee benefits" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clayton-cardinalli-GwOqUzrDSRM-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clayton-cardinalli-GwOqUzrDSRM-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.achievers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clayton-cardinalli-GwOqUzrDSRM-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2 aria-level="2">Employee benefits every company should offer </h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are over 300 types of benefits that employers are offering their talent. Below are some of the benefits considered most important to engaging employees.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<h3>Employee recognition </h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Having a culture of recognition is crucial to developing an engaged workforce. This benefit tops the list because of the high value that</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/5-eye-opening-hr-stats-employee-recognition-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">employee recognition</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">brings to any organization. Employees who are regularly recognized feel more connected to the organization, reducing turnover rates and increasing productivity. The ideal way to experience the maximum benefits of employee recognition is based on two principles. One is that recognition should be an everyday event and not an occasional award. The second is that recognition should be given in real-time and in a variety of forms.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Recognition can include manager-to-employee, peer-to-peer, social, monetary, and any other form that has meaning to employees and the organization. A survey conducted by Clutch, a B2B research company, found that</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nearly-half-of-office-workers-value-community-in-the-workplace-682214991.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">47 percent of all employees value a community atmosphere</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">in the workplace, with 55 percent of millennials feeling that way. Creating a culture of recognition is an ideal strategy for establishing and supporting your organization&#8217;s community atmosphere, even on a global scale. Recognition sends an organization-wide message that employees are not nameless, faceless people who are cogs in a revenue-producing machine.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> According to <a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/2020-engagement-retention-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an Achievers report</a>, 91 percent of employees &#8220;strongly&#8221; or &#8220;somewhat&#8221; agreed a strong recognition culture makes a company attractive to work for.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the right</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">employee recognition platform</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, organizations can easily recognize an employee&#8217;s individual accomplishments, team performance, innovative ideas, collaborative skills, birthdays, anniversaries, and any other event deserving of a celebration. You may develop awards for safety, performance, wellness, and departmental success, or perhaps you have an &#8220;Employee of the Month&#8221; or &#8220;President&#8217;s Club&#8221; award. That&#8217;s what recognition really is all about: Celebrating personal and work achievements and success.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<h3>Employee rewards </h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The days of giving employees an annual ham and a handshake are long gone. Just like recognition has meaning, so should rewards. Benefits management company Alight&#8217;s survey found that employees who believe the rewards meet their needs are</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://alight.com/our-story/newsroom/new-study-from-alight-solutions-reveals-that" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">seven times more likely to be engaged</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">at work compared to employees who don&#8217;t feel that way about their rewards.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The most effective reward system lets employees choose their reward. For example, employees can earn points for great work and then redeem those points for a reward of their choosing. The rewards offered can include anything from gift cards, travel savings, charitable contributions, the latest tech item, and trendy fashion apparel. Some organizations develop a unique reward system to include rewards like a day off to perform charity work or to attend a child&#8217;s out-of-town athletic event.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<h3>Wellness programs </h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">More organizations are offering wellness programs according to the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/Documents/2018%20Employee%20Benefits%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">annual SHRM survey</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. From 2017 to 2018, 44 percent of organizations increased their wellness benefits and 75 percent of employers offered a general wellness program, wellness resources and/or wellness information. Wellness program features include things like management of chronic health conditions, fitness challenges, health monitoring programs, yoga classes for stress reduction, and nutrition workshops or healthy food choices in workplace cafeterias and vending machines. When you see small groups of people walking every day during lunch hour, they are likely participating in a wellness program.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<h3>Family-friendly leave benefits </h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The U.S. population is aging. According to the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/cb18-41-population-projections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">U.S. Census Bureau</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, by the year 2030 all baby boomers will be over the age of 65. By the year 2035, there will be 78 million people who are over 65 years old. Older people tend to have more needs, like more medical appointments. Caregiving is usually the responsibility of younger family members. To address this issue, employers offer family leave benefits that include paid or unpaid time off to care for parents or extended family members in need of caregiving services. This is a need that will rapidly increase due to the aging population.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<h3>Flexible work schedules </h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Work-life balance is a common concern among today&#8217;s employees, especially millennials and Gen Z. Technology plays a part in employees wanting flexible work schedules and in employers being able to offer them. Flexible work schedules include telecommuting or working from home (or the coffee shop!), four-day work weeks, flexible work hours, and job sharing. A Deloitte study found that almost</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/the-millennial-workplace-of-future-is-almost-here-these-3-things-are-about-to-change-big-time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">75 percent of millennials</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">believe that having the option of working remotely or working from home is important.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236183/thinking-flexibly-flexible-work-arrangements.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Gallup analytics</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">found that 53 percent of employees say work-life balance is very important when considering whether to take a job, and flexible work arrangements are central to enabling work-life balance. Flexible work schedules also address growing urbanization and its challenges, like traffic jams.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<h3>Employee assistance programs </h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is a safety net for employees who must cope with stressful personal or work issues that create stress or anxiety. The work-based intervention program helps employees resolve stress-inducing problems. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America says that 72 percent of people who have daily stress say it interferes with their lives at least moderately,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://adaa.org/workplace-stress-anxiety-disorders-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">and 40 percent experience persistent stress</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">in their daily lives.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">People don&#8217;t leave their personal selves at the door when they show up for work. At the same time, work-related stress can cause problems in the personal lives of employees. The EAP offers employees resources that help them navigate life issues that may impact their ability to remain productive, like counselors specializing in mental health, substance abuse, financial difficulties, managing work changes, and family conflicts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<h3>Career development opportunities </h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Deloitte does an annual</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/millennialsurvey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">millennial survey</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and the last one found that millennials and Gen Z are concerned about their lack of readiness for industry 4.0. Only 36 percent of millennials and 29 percent of Gen X believe their employers do enough to help them develop the skills and knowledge to thrive in industry 4.0, build interpersonal skills, and develop confidence and ethical behaviors.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The global consulting firm Mercer surveyed large employers in 2018 to investigate voluntary turnover. Millennials accounted for</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/workers-are-quitting-jobs-record-numbers.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">half of the separations at 51 percent</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and Gen X accounted for 25 percent. The Mercer study found the two top reasons people left was for promotion opportunities and career changes. Another way to say it is that the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/why-people-really-quit-their-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">top reasons talent leave</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">an organization because they feel stale in their jobs, have no upward mobility, or are not gaining new skills or developing their strengths.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<h3>Transparency and feedback</h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Organizations need to encourage transparency in the workplace and implementing an employee feedback system is a key strategy. Employees who believe their voice is heard in the workplace are</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2018/02/why-equality-and-diversity-need-to-be-priorities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">4.6 time more likely to feel empowered</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">and to perform their best work. A formal feedback process gives everyone an equal voice and an equal opportunity to express that voice, reducing the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2018/06/3-biases-that-hijack-performance-reviews-and-how-to-address-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">biases</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">found in one-on-one annual performance reviews.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Ongoing feedback</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/how-to-empower-employees-and-build-trust/"><span data-contrast="none">builds trust</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">between employees and between employees and their managers. Gathering feedback in real-time goes beyond just an annual performance review and holds value for any organization looking to improve.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">The most</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://resources.achievers.com/resources/the-new-engagement-conversation-workplace-chatbots-and-the-science-behind-achievers-allie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">effective feedback tools</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> enable managers to continually listen to employees, take action, and impact engagement right away.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To meet the needs of today&#8217;s employees, the feedback process should be fluid and personal. Fortunately, technology makes this easy through tools like chatbots, pulse surveys, and check-ins. State-of-the-art programs, like</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/what-we-offer/listen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Achievers Listen,</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">are designed to always be on and open, capturing what&#8217;s important to employees. </span></p>
<h3>Perks, perks, and more perks </h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One of the advantages of a benefits program is that employers can customize the offerings to fit the needs of their employees. Some companies offer to reimburse employees for student loans or tuition expenses, or they make student loan payments. Providing access to affordable daycare is growing in popularity. Employers are adding daycare facilities on-site, offering reimbursement for a percentage of daycare expenses, or signing contracts with a nearby daycare to provide reduced cost services to employees.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Perks can be anything you want them to be. There&#8217;s a reason more companies are having &#8220;bring your pet to work&#8221; days and offering yoga classes and creating quiet space. These perks make employees happy!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>

<h2 aria-level="2">Employee benefits are engagement tools </h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So after all this, what are employee benefits? There is no doubt at all that benefits have taken on new importance as employee engagement tools. The needs and expectations of the modern workforce have changed considerably with the appearance of millennials, and now Gen Z, in the workforce.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}"> </span></p>
